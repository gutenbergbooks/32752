<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>When the Sikkim-Tibet Mission Force
marched to Lhassa, it carried along with it,
besides fighting men and diplomatists, a
strong contingent that represented literature
and the deeper sciences. We were full of
brains in that Lhassa column. There were
men in it who had made the subject of Tibet
their own before they had set foot in the
country, and were already qualified to discourse
upon it, whether in its political, its
topographical, its ethnological, or its arch√¶ological
aspect. There was a man who came
with us armed only with a bicycle wheel and
a cyclometer, with which he has corrected all
preconceived notions of Tibetan distances.
There was a man with a hammer (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
'Martol Walah Sahib' the natives called
him), who, if his pony stumbled over a stone,
got off his pony and beat the stone with his
hammer, not really vindictively but merely to
find out what precious ore the stone might
contain. Then there was a man with a
butterfly-net, who pickled the flies that got
into his eye, and chased those that did not
with his butterfly-net and pickled them also.
There was a man too with a trowel, who did
a lot of useful weeding by the roadside.
There was a committee too of licensed curio-hunters,
who collected curios with much enterprise
and scientific precision for the British
Museum. Lastly, there was a select band
of press correspondents, who threw periodical
literary light on our proceedings from start
to finish.</p>

<p>Who can doubt that all the above-named
are not now, in this month of November 1904,
writing for their lives, so as to produce at the
earliest opportunity the results of their scientific
or literary labours in the shape of books that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
will give valuable information to the serious
student, or prove a substantial contribution to
literature?</p>

<p>Apart from the above enterprises, a flood
of Blue-books, compiled by the authorised
political and military officials, will doubtless
also shortly appear, even though that appearance
may in some cases be but a swift transference
from the printing-press to the pigeonhole.</p>

<p>Surely, then, for one who is not ordered
by authority to compile a Blue-book, who has
no gospel of Tibetan scientific discoveries to
proclaim to the world, and who has no
harvest&mdash;in the shape of letters previously
sent to the press and capable of republication&mdash;ready
at hand for reaping, to sit down and
write a book on Tibet, merely because he
happens to have been to Lhassa and back, is
a work of supererogation which needs a word
of apology.</p>

<p>My apology is that this book will be
avowedly a book by a 'man in the street'&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
man, that is, who occupied an inconspicuous
single-fly tent in a back street of the brigade
camp. As such it will throw no searching
light upon the subject, but may afford a
simple but distinctive view of it, and one
uncaught by the searchlights of the official
minute, the scientist's lore, and the war correspondent's
art.</p>

<p>But, my prospective reader, as you
finger this slight volume at the bookstall,
I trust that this preface may at once catch
your eye, so that, if what you want to read
about Tibet is an elaborate appreciation or a
collection of solid information, you may drop
the book like the proverbial hot potato
before that jealous-eyed man behind the stall
makes you buy it as a punishment for fingering
it, and may seize instead upon one of
those weightier tomes that are now racing it
through the press.</p>

<small>THE WRITING ON THE WALL</small></h2>

<p>'Ain't this ripping?' said I to my wife.</p>

<p>'Yes, delightful,' she said.</p>

<p>It really was rather nice. It had been
quite hot in the plains, and was pleasantly
cool up here. My wife and family had preceded
me and had been settled for some
weeks in the house which we had taken in
the hills for the hot weather, and now I had
just arrived on two months' leave. We
were sitting over the fire in the drawing-room
after dinner, a cosy little room made
homelike by a careful selection of draperies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
and ornaments from the larger drawing-room
in the plains.</p>

<p>'Just ripping,' I repeated with sad lack
of originality. The ride up the hill from the
plains had been fatiguing. The fire was
soporific. There was whiskey and soda at
my elbow and a cheroot in my mouth (I'm
a privileged husband and smoke in the
drawing-room).</p>

<p>'Ripping,' I said for the third time, half
dozing.</p>

<p>'Come, get up, lazy-bones, and go to
bed. You are hopeless as you are.'</p>

<p>So I was led to bed. We put out the
lamps, and on the hall table found our bedroom
candles, which we lit preparatory to
climbing the stairs. The staircase set me
musing. Some hill houses have them, but
they are rare in the plains. The smallness
of the rooms, the existence of that narrow
staircase, the domestic process of lighting
the bedroom candles, the necessity of not
waking the baby, the sense of security and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of being cut adrift even temporarily from the
ties of officialdom&mdash;all suggested the peaceful
conditions of life enjoyed by the small but
solid householder at home.</p>

<p>'We've got it at last,' I exclaimed.</p>

<p>'Got what?' asked my wife.</p>

<p>'Why, the life of the bank clerk at home,'
I replied; 'that bank clerk whom we have
always envied, who lives at Tooting in a
little house just like this, with a creaking
staircase just like this, who never gets
harried from pillar to post, who is peaceful
and domestic, and gets fat as soon as he can
afford to. And here I am, for two months
at any rate, and I'm living in a Tooting villa
just like the bank clerk, and in the bosom of
my family, and I'm going to get fat too.'</p>

<p>So up we went to bed, full of peace.
There was a big black centipede crawling on
the bedroom wall, a sinister-looking object,
looking on the white surface like mysterious
handwriting, bringing with it to the fanciful
mind suggestions of 'Mene, Mene, Tekel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
Upharsin.' My wife has a horror of centipedes.
I was at once detailed to destroy it:
a feat soon accomplished.</p>

<p>'That dispels the bank clerk idea altogether,
does it not?' one of us remarked
to the other. 'Bank clerks at Tooting don't
have centipedes on their bedroom walls, do
they?'</p>

<p>When I had gone to my dressing-room,
I heard the sound below of a key turning in a
lock. It was a servant opening the back door.</p>

<p>A moment later I heard the tread of the
servant's bare feet on the stairs. This was
unusual. My bearer does not voluntarily
visit me at this hour.</p>

<p>Yes, it was the bearer. He came to the
dressing-room door and presented me with
a telegram. It was 'urgent,' as denoted by
the yellow colour of the envelope. 'Urgent'
telegrams when addressed to officers on leave
are apt to involve some interference with
their plans.</p>

<p>I read the telegram and signed the receipt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
The servant asked if he was wanted any more.
'Yes, very much wanted,' I answered; 'but go
downstairs now and I'll call you later.'</p>

<p>Then came the process of breaking
the news to my wife. It is difficult not to
be clumsy on these occasions. I went into
the bedroom with the telegram concealed
somewhere on my person. There she sat
unconcerned, and I had to break it to her and
did not know how to begin. I got to within
a foot or two of her and then stopped, held
out a beckoning hand to her, and said roughly:</p>

<p>'Come here.'</p>

<p>'What is it?' she said, sitting transfixed.
There was something in my face which
alarmed her.</p>

<p>I beckoned again, and again said, 'Come
here.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' she cried, 'take it off, take it off!
It must be a centipede on my shoulder that
you are pointing at. I know it must be.'</p>

<p>'No, dear, it's not half so bad as that: it's
only that I'm ordered to Tibet.'</p>

<small>PRELIMINARIES</small></h2>

<p>The next day was Sunday&mdash;not a good day
on which to start preparations. I had a great
many things to do. The first was to visit
the civil surgeon, and be examined for fitness
for residing in high altitudes. He lived at
the top of a steep hill himself, and as I
arrived there on foot but alive, he passed
me without difficulty. Then my pony who
had come with me had to be despatched with
the syce on two double marches to the railway
terminus. Then I had to procure free
railway passes from the station staff officer,
whose office, the day being Sunday, was of
course closed. There was also the putting
of oneself, on the one hand, and one's wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
and family on the other, on sound financial
bases, preparatory to an indefinite period of
separation. There was also a lot of sorting
and packing to be done, and farewell visits
to be made, where these were officially expected
of one. (One's real friends, of course,
one left without a thought.)</p>

<p>I got off on the Monday. People at
home are often horror-struck at the speed
with which the married officer has to leave
his family when ordered on service. Fond
parents have been known to forbid their
daughters marrying soldiers on this very
account. They are quite wrong. Given
that you have to separate, it is much better
to get the separation over as quickly as
possible. In this case the speed with which
those busy thirty-six hours passed between
the receipt of the telegram and my departure
was a real godsend. A long-drawn-out
anticipation of separation would by comparison
have been intolerable.</p>

<p>My wife came to the top of the road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
that leads to the plains to see me off. The
quickest mode of conveyance was the 'rickshaw.'
There ought to be some glamour of
romance about a wife seeing her husband off
to the wars, but how could there be when
the husband started in a rickshaw? I
stepped solemnly into the vehicle, and an
officious 'jampani' tried to tuck me up with
a rug as though I had been something very
dainty and precious, while my wife, who still
preserves a critical eye for Indian manners
and customs, exclaims:&mdash;</p>

<p>'Oh dear, oh dear, this is a funny country,
when one's husband starts for field service in
a perambulator!'</p>

<p>The rickshaw carried me at break-neck
pace to the plains, where, with my ears singing
from the sudden drop of 6,000 feet, and
the heat oppressing me, I took train to my
former station, to which I had to make a
detour before proceeding to the base.</p>

<p>It was a terrible two days that I had here.
Dismantling a furnished house, packing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
warehousing your household <ins class="corr" title="original had: gods">goods</ins> paying
your outstanding bills, having parting drinks
at your friends' expense, giving certificates
of saintly character to every black man who
has ever served you in any capacity during
the past two years, and who drops from the
clouds for his 'chitthi' as soon as your final
departure from the station becomes known,
sorting, repairing, and supplementing your
camp kit, fitting out yourself, your servant,
and your horse with warm clothing&mdash;these
and countless other matters filled to the brim
those forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>At last I was in the train for Calcutta.
I met two major-generals of my acquaintance
at different points during the journey.
They both congratulated me warmly on the
quest upon which I was going, each independently
remarking, not upon the unexampled
professional experience that I was likely to
acquire, but on the fact that Tibet was an
A1 place for curios! Nice and human of
them, I thought, to put that first! One of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
them, I fear, was rather incommoded by the
numerous articles of kit which I had with
me in the carriage, and which overflowed
somewhat into his portion of it. He was,
I knew, a great authority on the scientific
reduction of transport, and, when I apologised
somewhat sheepishly for crowding him, made
some grim remark about the liberal scale of
baggage per officer that was doubtless being
allowed to us; so I had to impress upon him
that I stood an even chance of being kept at
the base, and so had to be prepared for
all emergencies, even a ten days' leave to
Darjiling. Whereat he smiled more grimly
than ever.</p>

<p>Don't travel from Northern India to
Calcutta in May, if you can help it. It is
not very hot when you start, but every mile
you travel you find it growing hotter. You
get baked as you traverse the dry plains of
the United Provinces, you get fried as you
reach a greasier climate further South, and
in the humid atmosphere of Lower Bengal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the sensation is that of being boiled. You
get out of the train in Howrah station at
Calcutta done all to shreds.</p>

<p>After a few hours in Calcutta I took the
Darjiling mail train which was due the following
morning at Siliguri, the latter being
the base of the Tibet Expedition. In the
train I was accompanied by a throng of
Calcutta folk going up to Darjiling for their
'week-end.' Calcutta, apart from other
attributes, is a great emporium of drapery
and millinery goods, and it was quite natural
to find myself sharing a carriage with a
gentleman who in the course of conversation
revealed himself as the head of a large firm
of haberdashers. He was a delightful travelling
companion, and regaled me with tales
illustrative of the humorous side of his
business. He was at his best when describing
his most successful corset fitter, a
damsel blessed apparently both with a slim
waist and a strong arm. With the former
she advertised the latest thing in corsets, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
with the latter she fitted the said corset on
to figures less graceful than her own. All
went well till one day she surpassed herself
by transforming a certain stately matron into
a veritable sylph. This lady went home
pleased and proud, but in an hour's time an
indignant letter accompanied by the fragments
of a corset reached the manager, the letter
demanding the return of the money expended
on the corset, on the ground that the latter,
on the wearer having cleared her throat with
a gentle cough, had burst in several places
with a loud report.</p>

<p>But just then the train steamed into
Siliguri station, and I had to leave my friend
and his pleasant tales of frills and furbelows
and plunge into war, bloody war.</p>

<small>THE BASE</small></h2>

<p>I have been too long describing the preliminaries
that were necessary before joining the
Expedition, but there is some excuse for
doing so. For after all those preliminaries,
with their suddenness and their hurry and
rush, were distinctly typical of the Indian
Frontier Expedition. When soldiers serving
the Imperial Government are ordered on a
campaign, they generally have some warning.
Foreign politics have generally been
simmering in the pot for some time before
the pot overboils. But on the Indian
Frontier some irresponsible ruffians perpetrate
some sudden outrage, which, without
any word of warning, involves the instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
despatch of troops to the scene of action.
The result is a scramble, an individual
example of which I have tried above to
describe.</p>

<p>In all books on wars a constant comparison
will be found drawn between the school-boy
and the soldier on service. I dare say I
shall find myself working that comparison to
death. It occurred to me first as I reached
Siliguri, and, jostling with other fellows, rushed
to the Staff Office there, to discover what
was my next destination. We felt like
schoolboys, who, at the beginning of term,
rush to inquire whether they have given us
our remove, or who anxiously await the publication
of the notice which will tell them
whether they are to represent their house at
football. There was the same excitement
before we learnt our fate. There was that
boyish jubilation on the part of those who
were off to the front, and vulgar schoolboy
language from those who were to be detained
at the base or in Sikkim.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>My orders were to go to Gnatong as a
temporary measure. This was dubious, and
might mean being stuck there or in a similar
place indefinitely, or might mean being
eventually sent forward. Those who knew
it told me that Gnatong was a horrible place,
that it snowed there daily from October 1
till May 31, and rained from June 1 to September
30, that it was always in the clouds,
and that it was approached by a stony road,
as steep as the side of a house, which would
knock one's pony's feet to bits. The height
of the place was twelve thousand odd feet,
and it was situated in Sikkim some ten miles
on the near side of the Tibetan frontier.</p>

<p>I had to wait some days at Siliguri till
my pony and some of my kit, which the railway
authorities had not let travel as fast as
I had, should catch me up.</p>

<p>There were several detached officers also
waiting here, and the units forming the
reinforcements were coming in daily. We
turned half the refreshment room into a sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
of station mess, having our meals at one long
table. I suppose a contemplative person
would have noted those accidental details
which differentiated us from the ordinary
travellers by the Darjiling-Calcutta mails,
who had their meals at the other long table.
There we were, the brutal and licentious
soldiery feasting and drinking and gambling
with shameless <i>abandon</i>, while those worthy
men of affairs from Calcutta and their excellent
ladies took their meals hastily and in
sober earnest alongside of us. Some of us
must have presented a queer spectacle. I
remember in particular one youthful officer,
whom I afterwards lost sight of, but who was
the most ardent young Napoleon I have met
for a long time. He had apparently started
growing his beard the day he left his cantonment.
He was of the Esau type, and the
growth was brisk. The colour was ginger,
not the chastened sort that is sprinkled over
with sugar, but the crude dark ginger you
get in jars. He affected short khaki shorts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
as suitable for the soldier in hill warfare. He
also affected a khaki cardigan jacket. He
had left his helmet behind him, and wore
only a khaki pugree with a khaki 'kula'
in the centre of it. I used to see ladies, who
came in for a quiet cup of tea, glancing
sidelong at him. Some were doubtless impressed,
and went away enthusiastic about
that young warrior. But in the eyes of
others I fancy I saw a twinkle.</p>

<p>At last my pony with his syce and the
missing kit arrived, and I was enabled to
start for Gnatong the next day.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>TO GNATONG</small></h2>

<p>I marched to Gnatong as a passenger&mdash;that
is to say, though I accompanied troops, I
yet did no duty with them. The camping
grounds <i>en route</i> were small clearings in the
jungle, so small that not more than two or
three hundred men and two or three hundred
animals could be encamped at any one
spot on a given day. Hence the reinforcements
were marching up in very small
columns. It was one of these which I accompanied
as far as Gnatong.</p>

<p>About two or three days' marching takes
you out of India into Sikkim, but you are in
the heart of the jungle almost as soon as
you leave Siliguri. For about seven days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
you hardly rise at all, merely following the
course upstream of the Teesta river, and later
on of one of its tributaries.</p>

<p>That belt of 'terai' jungle which fringes
the skirt of the whole Himalayan range has
its own special charms. It is a fine sporting
country for those who are on pleasure bent
and are mounted on elephants, on which
alone is it possible to penetrate the thick
breast-high undergrowth. Even for troops
marching along a road running through its
midst, it has a certain fascination. The
incessant call of the jungle-fowl on either
side of you, the constant shade, so unusual
in India, the bright orchids in the tree-tops,
the heavy luxuriance of vegetation that loads
the air with scents that are generally sweet,
the gorgeous butterflies, the steamy hothouse
atmosphere&mdash;all combine to form a kind of
sedative, suggestive of the lotus-flower, of
pleasant physical enervation, and perpetual
afternoon. One could enjoy this feeling as
one sat idly on one's pony, till it was dispelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
by the rain. It rained very heavily
all those days. Even when it did not rain
the air was so laden with moisture that the
very clothes you wore were always wet on
the outside. The rain too was of the sort
that did not cool or stir the air; the thermometer
stood perpetually at a high figure,
and existence on the inside of a mackintosh
during one of those showers was a protracted
torture of prickly heat.</p>

<p>We reached Rangpo&mdash;the town that lies
on the border of independent as opposed to
British Sikkim&mdash;after four days' marching.
I call it a town, for it certainly possessed
one street and a bazaar, and swarmed with
natives other than those belonging to the
force. The ordinary native of Sikkim seems
to be a half-breed, looking partly Aryan,
partly Mongolian, and less Aryan and more
Mongolian as one penetrates further into the
country. Their women are rather picturesque.
They do not give you quite the
same cheery unblushing greeting as you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
generally get from the regular hill woman of
Mongolian type, but they do not hide their
faces jealously from you, like the women on
the plains of India. In dress they largely
affect black velveteen. It would be interesting
to know from where that velveteen
comes, though I think it could, like the iridescent
shawls and the stocking suspenders
that are so largely worn by the brave men of
Bengal, be traced to Manchester or Birmingham.
It must have been an enterprising
bagman who first went round Sikkim and
persuaded the Sikkimese ladies that black
velveteen was the match <i>par excellence</i> for
their complexions.</p>

<p>At length we began to climb a little, ever
so little, and after two more days reached
Lingtam in pouring rain. This was the last
of our level going; from here to Gnatong
we were to climb continuously, and at as
steep a gradient as laden mule with straining
breast-piece could hope to tackle. The Lingtam
camp was even smaller, more uneven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and damper than the others had been.
I found a convenient difficulty arising as
to where my tent could be fitted in, and
simultaneously heard of the existence of
a bungalow at Sedonchan, three miles beyond.
I was tied by no duty to the
column, so determined to reach Sedonchan
that afternoon, and push on to Gnatong the
next day.</p>

<p>Those three miles to Sedonchan involved
a climb of four thousand feet, up a rough
dripping bridle-path paved with cobbles, not
nice smooth-rounded cobbles, but roughly
cut spiky stones. I have said the path was
paved with cobbles, but should have added
that it had a supplementary pavement of
horse-shoes.</p>

<p>At first in my ignorance I thought of
picking one up for luck, but a yard ahead I
saw another one, and then met others at
close intervals all the way, so decided that
all that good fortune could not be meant
for me, and had better be left well alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
It was a good farrier who could so shoe a
horse that he would lose no shoe between
Lingtam and Gnatong.</p>

<p>I don't know in the least what sort of
place Sedonchan may be. It rained all the
time, some fourteen hours, that I stayed there,
and was shrouded in mist. So that if I ever
went there again the place would still possess
the charm of novelty.</p>

<p>The next morning I found that my pony
had shared the lot of most animals along
that road and cast a shoe. Farriers don't
grow on the wayside in Sikkim, so there
was no alternative but to walk up to
Gnatong. This involved a climb of about
six thousand feet, and then a drop into
Gnatong of about one thousand. I overtook
the Royal Fusiliers during my walk; they
had camped for the night in a puddle called
Jaluk which lies half-way between Sedonchan
and Gnatong. It was during this march of
theirs that I believe the following dialogue
was overheard:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>'What-ho, Bill!' said Atkins <ins class="corr" title="missing period inserted">No.</ins> 1.
'What do they mean by calling this something
country a something tableland? 'Tain't no
something tableland, this 'ere ain't.'</p>

<p>'Garrn,' answered Atkins No. 2, 'it's a
something tableland right enough, and this
'ere as we are climbing is the something legs
of the something table.'</p>

<p>Fill in the adjectives to taste, or <i>√† la</i>
Mr. Kipling, and you get the real flavour of
the dialogue.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>MOUNTAIN SICKNESS: GNATONG: WAYSIDE
WITTICISMS</small></h2>

<p>Those ailments which are described by the
word sickness, joined to a prefix, are of two
kinds. Either the prefix is the cause of the
disease, as in the case of sea sickness, or the
expression is a <i>lucus a non lucendo</i>, as in
the case of 'home sickness,' the cause of the
sickness being in the latter case the exact
contradictory of the prefix. Sometimes the
two kinds are combined, as in the case of
love sickness, when both love itself and also
the lack of love are the simultaneous cause of
the disorder.</p>

<p>Mountain sickness, on the other hand,
may be of either kind, though not of both at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
once. I have often had bad mountain sickness
of the one kind in the plains of India.
Any one who has spent his boyhood scampering
over Scotch hills or in similar pastimes is
peculiarly prone to this form of the disease
towards the end of a hot June. Ten days'
leave, or more if possible, is then the only
remedy. I had never experienced the
other form till I reached Gnatong. I don't
exactly know how doctors describe it in
diagnosis. I believe, though, that they
attribute it in some way to your blood not
running up the hill as fast as you do yourself,
which results in blood collecting in your toes,
which ought to be running about your brain
and lungs. Hence giddiness, nausea, headache,
loss of appetite, insomnia, difficulty in
breathing, and, saddest of all in some cases,
an utter inability to enjoy either your drink
or your tobacco.</p>

<p>I got it badly with all the symptoms,
including the last two. I was supposed to
be very busy helping to see each column<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
onwards. They were got through without
difficulty&mdash;no one would stay at Gnatong an
hour longer than he could help. So I suppose
I performed my share of the work all
right, though it was done from bed. There
was no one there to supervise my work, and
I therefore did not have to go upon the sick
list; but even so the feeling of being incapacitated
by some accidental ailment at the
beginning of an expedition, and of its possibly
preventing you from reaching the front, is
one of the most trying of ordeals.</p>

<p>The number of victims of mountain sickness
at Gnatong was considerable. There
was an enterprising Parsi merchant who had
opened a store there. His wealth of tinned
provisions and whiskey lay in the shop comparatively
disregarded, but he did a roaring
trade in phenacetin and Stearne's headache
cure among the mountain sick.</p>

<p>Mountain sickness is like measles. If
you get a really good go of it, you are not
likely to be soon attacked again by it, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
though you have to ascend to an altitude far
higher than that at which you originally succumbed.
Many a man lay gasping for
several days at Gnatong, which was only
twelve thousand odd feet up, and later on
climbed the Karo-L√† (16,800 feet) on his
own flat feet, smiling.</p>

<p>'The last long streak of snow' was just
fading as I reached Gnatong at the end of
May. It was not very cold, but bitterly raw
and damp. I occupied a hut, which contained
a fireplace, and would have made
myself cosy and warm if the fire had not
always smoked. This involved that distressing
dilemma between having a fire and also
a roomful of smoke, which had to be periodically
emptied by opening the door and
window, and so letting in cold and rain and
mist, or sitting in a chilly damp atmosphere
without a fire, but, on the other hand, without
either smoke or violent draughts. This is a
petty detail, but I mention it, since to the
many people who spent their time mainly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
posts on the line of communication, and lived
in huts, this must have been an ever-recurring
dilemma and a primary feature of
their existence.</p>

<p>Gnatong had been an important place
during the last Sikkim Expedition. For the
purposes of the present Expedition it has been
renovated. The men so employed had been
merry fellows, with eyes for that nice, innocent,
feeble, but well-meant joke, which you
appreciate on service, even though in peace
time you might elect to be bored by it.
These hut builders and road makers had
been lavish of sign-posts. The Gnatong post
was placarded everywhere on the inside with
the names of its tiny streets. It appeared
that we were occupying what was on the
whole a straggling but quite a fashionable
part of London. I myself lived at 'Hyde
Park Corner.' The post commandant, if I
remember right, occupied a mansion in
'Carlton Gardens.' We went for constitutionals
up and down 'Rotten Row,' and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
found 'Buckingham Palace' used as a supply
depot.</p>

<p>This art of writing mildly amusing notice-boards
was not confined to Gnatong. On a
bit of the military road near Chumbi, where
the roadmakers had to revet it carefully to
prevent it falling into the river, there was a
neat little sign-board describing this strip of
roadway as 'The Embankment.' Outside
the d√¢k bungalow at Rangpo was a large
placard on which was printed 'Mount Nelson
Hotel. No Ragging allowed.' On the top
of the Natu-L√†&mdash;one of the passes dividing
Sikkim from Tibet&mdash;there is the following:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 224px;">
<img src="images/i030sign.png" width="224" height="300" alt="" title="" />
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Poor jokes all of them, aren't they? but
just as poor fare can be eaten with a relish
after a hard day's marching; so poor jokes
tickle the mental palate of the simple soldier
and the stupid officer on service, just as
effectively as do good ones.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>OVER THE JALAP-L√Ä: CHUMBI: BEARDS</small></h2>

<p>After a week of Gnatong I was ordered to
Chumbi, where the reinforcements and a
portion of the old force had been concentrating
preparatory to what is officially
described as 'the second advance to
Gyantse.'</p>

<p>My way lay through Kapap over the
Jalap-L√†, and down through Langram and
Rinchingong, and thence to Chumbi. The
<i>pi√®ce de r√©sistance</i> was the part between
Kapap and Langram. There is an easy
uninteresting pass between Gnatong and
Kapap. Kapap itself looked a bleak dismal
spot, lying all in the clouds at the end of a
long dark lake. From here you rise to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
top of the Jalap-L√†, which is about 14,900
feet high. The suffix 'L√†' denotes a 'pass.'
There was snow on the pass which covered
the road in some places. I got into a small
drift once, my pony flopping down suddenly
till his girths were in the snow. He knew
nothing about snow in those days, and must
have been very much astonished. One's
first acquaintance with so high an altitude
impresses one greatly. There is something
so strange about the atmosphere that one
feels as though one were in another planet.
The effect of the atmosphere on distances is
most curious. You see the details of a hill
in the distance so clearly that it seems far
nearer than it is. Distance-judging by eye
for military purposes in high altitudes is an
art governed by rules entirely different from
those that govern it at an ordinary elevation.</p>

<p>I was a bit weak after my attack of
mountain sickness, and stuck to my pony's
back the whole way. I felt a natural
anxiety with regard to the native followers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
who accompanied me&mdash;an orderly, a syce,
and a bearer. They were all three plainsmen.
Hills of any size whatever were quite
strange to them. Whether they would live
at the height of Mont Blanc was a question
of some moment. I expected at any time to
see one or other of them lying down gasping
like a freshly caught fish. I think they all
died in imagination many times before they
reached the top of the pass. They turned
wild eyes of anguish and reproach towards
me whenever I waited to see how they were
getting on. Eventually I found it best to
leave them to themselves, and only know
that they arrived down the far side alive, but
expressing a poor opinion of Tibet as a
country (for we now were in Tibet).</p>

<p>The walk down to Langram was trying
to the toes, but brought us off the bare
mountain tops and into a region of pine-woods,
the very smell of which is always
comforting. Here I stopped the night,
descending next morning to Rinchingong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
which is in the Chumbi valley, and stands
barely over 9,000 feet. Two miles above
Rinchingong we had passed Yatun, the
frontier Tibetan village built against that
Chinese wall which stretched as a barrier
right across the valley, but has since been
demolished by British dynamite. Here,
besides the dwellings of some Tibetan inhabitants,
were the houses of the British
official who controls the Chinese customs in
this direction, and of Miss Annie Taylor,
the lady missionary who has worked for
long, and all alone, among the Tibetans of the
border, nursing them in sickness, and telling
them of Christianity. 'Ani' is Tibetan for
nun, and the name 'Ani memsahib' has
therefore a double signification to those who
use it.</p>

<p>The first glimpse of a building on the
north side of the Jalap-L√† proclaims the
fact that you are no longer in India or under
the influence of Indian ideals of domestic
or other architecture. The houses in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Chumbi valley are not, however, as typically
Tibetan as those further north, being far
more Chinese in appearance. It is, in fact,
curious that Chinese influence seems more
prevalent in the Chumbi valley than in any
other part of Eastern Tibet, except Lhassa
itself. The number of Chinamen actually
resident in the Chumbi valley is itself large,
and there seems to have been a great deal of
inter-marriage here at one time or another
between the local Tibetans and Chinamen
proper, the women of such unions having
of course been Tibetan, since the Chinaman,
when he goes roaming, invariably, I believe,
leaves his women folk at home.</p>

<p>The following day brought me into
Chumbi. It was pleasant to be in a big
camp again, to join a large mess, and get
the latest news from headquarters.</p>

<p>The valley itself was a delightful spot to
have reached. After the unpleasantnesses of
those heights that one had traversed, this
valley seemed a sheer Garden of Eden. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
was a place to dally in, in which to wander
about accompanied by your best girl, picking
wild flowers for her, and listening with
her to the humming of the bees, and the
bubbling of laughing brooks, rather than a
place in which to concentrate an army for an
advance into the enemy's country.</p>

<p>Chumbi would make a glorious summer
sanitarium for British troops in the hot
weather, provided that that projected route,
which is to avoid the passes and run through
Bhutan to the Bengal Duars, ever becomes
an accomplished fact. Two thousand feet
higher than most hill stations, and yet below
the really giddy heights, in a climate no
hotter at any time than an English summer,
never parched with drought and never visited
by protracted spells of rain, not perched on
an inconvenient hilltop away from its water
supply, but lying in a fertile valley, through
which runs a river of pure water that knows
not the germ of enteric, with enough flat
spaces to hold commodious barracks and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
provide good recreation grounds, it seems
that it would prove an altogether desirable
haven for the invalid soldiers from Calcutta
and the Presidency district.</p>

<p>A week spent here was pleasant enough,
enabling one, so to speak, to recover one's
breath after descending from those heights
we had left behind and before tackling
those in front. I soon learnt, with the same
school-boy jubilation to which I have previously
alluded, that I was to accompany the
advance.</p>

<p>Here, of course, at this rendezvous of
troops many old friends ran across one
another. It was sometimes difficult for two
friends to recognise each other on account of
the obstacles to recognition formed by their
respective beards. The soldier's service
beard, in its various forms and aspects, forms
an interesting study. There is, of course, the
ordinary dull beard grown by an adequately
but not outrageously hirsute person and
trimmed to a conventional shape, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
makes the wearer resemble any such normal
being as a naval officer, a parson, or respectable
middle-aged civilian of everyday life.
The only striking feature of this beard is
that it is productive of unexpected likenesses.
You have, for instance, known a brother officer
for many years, and never found him possessed
of any of the glamour of royalty; you
meet him on service wearing his beard, and
find he is the veritable double of the Prince
of Wales.</p>

<p>But there are other beards. There is,
for instance, what may be called the 'Infant
prodigy' beard, a monstrosity adorning the
chin of a quite youthful officer. The latter
may be put to serve under you. And it
takes time and much hardening of yourself
against external influences before you have
the effrontery to order the young gentleman
about, or tell him off when he is in error. I
remember an instance of a fairly senior captain
calling on a regimental mess and being
entertained during his visit by the only officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
of that regiment then present. The latter
possessed an 'Infant prodigy' beard, which
was also flecked with a few abnormal grey
hairs. I was in that mess too at the moment&mdash;in
the capacity of honorary member only&mdash;and
followed the interview with relish. The
senior captain was becomingly deferential,
and the youngster's grey beard wagged with
what appeared becoming dignity. At last a
light was brought in by a servant, for it was
growing dark, which flashed for a moment
on Mr. Greybeard's shoulder strap, and revealed
two simple subaltern's stars. The
gradual, almost imperceptible, change in the
senior captain's manner, and the corresponding
falling from his high estate of Mr. Greybeard
were interesting to watch. The former
soon got up to go.</p>

<p>'Damn that fellow! I mistook him for the
colonel,' is what I am sure he said to himself
when he got outside.</p>

<p>Then there is what may be called the
'British workman' beard&mdash;that is, the beard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
which is allowed to grow in its own sweet
way, and may adopt any of the sizes or
shapes that one sees on the faces of such
British workmen as never visit a barber.
This type also is productive of strange likenesses,
not to public personages or one's own
compeers, but to the men of the British
working class whom one has known in old
days. There were many officers so adorned
who made excellent gamekeepers or gillies,
and in particular I remember a certain
stalwart major whose beard grew in two
inverted horns that splayed outwards on his
chest, and who was the very image of my
father's old gardener. I once very nearly
addressed him as 'Horton' by mistake, for
that happened to have been the gardener's
name.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>TO PHARI</small></h2>

<p>The 'second advance' began in due course.
The first few camping grounds were small,
so that we had to proceed on the three
days' march to Phari in several columns, two
columns a day leaving Chumbi together, but
halting at separate camping grounds on the
way up, and meeting again at Phari.</p>

<p>This march to Phari was, until we
actually reached the Phari plain, quite the
wettest I have known. It rained incessantly.
The first day we climbed a few miles up to
Lingmatam. (How like one another the
names of places in this part of the world are!
It took me months to distinguish between
Lingtam, Langram, and Lingmatam.) From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Lingmatam (a sopping, spongy, flat little plain
nestling in the hills, that had obviously only
just missed its proper vocation of being a
lake instead of a plain) we marched up a
rough bridle-path through pine-woods to
Dhota. We had a very long train of pack-mule
transport in our column, and the checks
up that steep narrow winding path were
interminable, while rain fell the whole time.
Whenever anything went wrong with a
mule's load, which of course happened frequently
owing to the steepness and roughness
of the track, it was impossible to take the
mule aside to adjust the load, for there was
no room at the side, and the mule had to be
halted where he was till the adjustment was
completed. This involved the halting of say
five hundred mules, who happened to be
behind the mule who had first been halted.
And when the latter at last moved off, it of
course took an appreciable interval of time
before the next mule followed suit. Multiply
that appreciable interval by the number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
mules in the rear, say five hundred, and you
find that it takes perhaps a full half-hour
before the five-hundredth is at last on the
move again. Thus that initial adjustment
of a refractory load has cost the rear of the
column half an hour's delay, and by the
end of the half-hour you may be sure that
the load of another mule has got loose, and
the whole process has to be repeated. This
is just an instance of the trials of a transport
officer, and of his faithful servants, the transport
driver and the pack-mule.</p>

<p>I remember, during one such check, being
seated on my pony at a point of the road
where it was impossible to dismount for lack
of space, with one mule's head buried in my
pony's tail and another mule's tail flicking my
pony's nose, the rain trickling off my helmet
and down my neck, and, worst of all, a strong
aroma rising from the khud beneath where
lay the remains of a mule who had met his
death at that spot at a date that was palpably
neither very recent nor yet innocuously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
remote. To be bound almost literally hand
and foot in the vicinity of a bad smell is a
form of torture which in its way gives points
to any inquisition.</p>

<p>Dhota lies at a considerable height above
Lingmatam, and, before we reached camp,
many of the mule drivers were somewhat
exhausted with their climb. There was a
certain amount of almost inevitable straggling
on the part of some of them&mdash;a most
unfortunate occurrence, for it resulted in a
few leaving their mules to their own devices
just when the control of the latter was most
necessary. For after emerging from the
pine forest a few miles below Dhota we
came on to a hillside on which grew ever so
little of the deadly aconite plant. A check
would occur somewhere to the column.
Those mules who were left standing without
their drivers would&mdash;as is the nature of
the beast&mdash;try to improve the shining hour
by picking up a little grazing from the roadside.
Here and there a mule would swallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
some aconite, and the chances were that
before he reached camp he would foam at
the mouth and quickly expire. A few,
though poisoned, reached camp alive, and
of these a small proportion were saved by
drastic remedies. But the deaths that day
from aconite poisoning almost reached double
figures&mdash;a regrettable occurrence, for the
mule is an animal for whom, when one knows
him, one entertains affection, and, besides
this, each mule carries two maunds of useful
provisions on his back, and we were not too
well off for transport. After another wet
night on another wet camping ground, we
marched into Phari. We had left the green
valley of the Chumbi; we had mounted
upwards through the pine forests beyond;
we had emerged into a region of rugged
scenery where great rocky precipices hung
over us. We wondered what still wilder
regions we were now approaching as we still
climbed higher. But all of a sudden, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
seemed, we had reached the end of our climb
and found ourselves on a level green plain
with rolling green downs around us, the sort
of homely gentle scene that meets you when,
for instance, you cross the border between
England and Scotland, or pass on the railway
the lower fells of Cumberland&mdash;a scene
suggestive of sheep grazing on rich close
turf, and of comfortable homesteads hidden
away in the folds of the hills. This abrupt
transition brought to the mind the tale of
Jack and the Beanstalk. It seemed that we
had climbed to the top of the world that had
hitherto been ours, and were starting afresh
on a new level.</p>

<p>This sensation was chiefly illusory; for
that level green plain and those rolling green
downs deceived one with their greenness, and
proved on closer inspection to be but indifferent
pastures, while after a mile or two the
plain bent round a corner, and we came in
view of such mighty irregularities of the earth's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
surface as left no doubt as to our being still
in the very heart of the mountains. For as
we turned that corner, suddenly, as with a
sudden flash, and all lit up with the sunlight
that had just dispelled the clouds, Chumalari
stood before us, his white top only a few
miles away, but many thousand feet above
us, and so reaching to a height in the
sky that to the stranger's eye was almost
appalling.</p>

<p>To us men the romance of scenery is very
elusive. I have known nice old ladies to
whom a fine sunset was a real substantial joy,
giving them the same nocturnal exhilaration
that baser clay can only acquire by absorbing
a bottle of champagne. Given a male mind
properly swept and garnished for the time
being by some potent influence&mdash;preferably
of course a sweet influence of the feminine
gender&mdash;even the most businesslike and
prosaic of us can, if only for short intervals
at a time, empty ourselves of the things of
this ugly world and assimilate a little of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
nature's beauty. But in ordinary humdrum
life, when that sweet feminine influence is no
longer at his side (or, if still at his side, has
lost much of its old magic by having been
so foolish as to be now his mere wife), the
ordinary brutal humdrum man regards the
finest waterfall in the world as merely a good
place at which to dilute his whiskey, finds
blue sunlit waters rather trying to the eyes,
and execrates the glorious sweep of the
mountain in front of him as conducive to
perspiration and shortness of breath as he
climbs it. We can't help it, we men; we are
built that way; it is the nature of the beast.
But even so when by some strange accident
we are taken unawares, and some rare and
magnificent glory of nature suddenly confronts
us, and, without our consenting or even
against our will, pierces that crust of sordid
matter-of-factness that usually encases us so
securely, as did that great white mountain
Chumalari that day when we met him on the
Phari plain, then we too abandon ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
and for once in a way find ourselves drinking
in the beauty as greedily as ever that old
lady drinks in her sunset.</p>

<p>A few miles along the plain brought us to
Phari.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>TO KANGMA</small></h2>

<p>All our little columns concentrated at Phari.
Our camp was just outside the 'jong' or
fort. Phari-jong was quite typical of the
genus 'jong,' looking from the outside like the
sort of medi√¶val castle that sometimes adorns
the foreground of a drop-scene in a theatre.
On the inside it was rather extra-typical,
being even more rambling, darker, and dirtier
than most jongs. A grim humorist had
selected the topmost garret as the post-office.
This selection gave the local postmaster,
who was also possessed of grim humour, the
vastest entertainment. For the little columns
came pouring in day after day, bringing all
sorts of folk who were pining for their letters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Every one, as soon as he was off duty, went
head-down to the post-office. We were now
at a level of 15,000 feet, and the climb,
at that altitude, of several hundred feet of
rough Tibetan passages and staircases was a
great strain on the lungs to any one unused
to it.</p>

<p>The postmaster sat in his office, cool
and comfortable, while all day long officers,
British rank and file, sepoys and followers,
poured in for their letters, every one arriving
panting, with his tongue lolling out, and
quite unable to state his requirements for at
least two minutes. The postmaster made a
point of asking every one most politely what he
wanted at the very moment of his arrival, so
as not to keep him waiting, and grinned diabolically
at the desperate efforts of the latter
to splutter out his name and address. When,
as one of the victims in question, I went for
my letters, and had duly provided him with
my share of the entertainment, I asked him
whether he was not enjoying himself, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
assured me it was the best fun he had ever
had in his life.</p>

<p>From Phari to Kangma we marched in
two columns, of which I accompanied the
second.</p>

<p>The 'Tang-L√†' was our first halting-place&mdash;a
bleak spot very much swept by the
wind. From there we marched to Tuna, and
thence to Dochen, with Chumalari on our
right, showing us a new view of himself as
we rounded each spur that jutted out into the
plain. We passed many herds of the Kiang
or wild ass, some of us galloping after them
in an attempt to get a close view; but they
are fleet and wary, and evaded us altogether.
The simple peasant of that part of Tibet has
been known to allude to the Kiang as the
'children of Chumalari,' and thus to explain
their sanctity, for Chumalari himself is a
sacred mountain. Whether belief in this
origin of the Kiang is orthodox, or merely a
local superstition, I do not know.</p>

<p>Hereabouts we passed the 'hot springs,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
where still lay what was left of the corpses of
many Tibetans who had fallen in the fight
that had occurred there some months before.
We had, I am told, once actually buried these
corpses when we found that the enemy were
making no effort in that direction; but the
Tibetans, holding curious theories on the
subject, had again unearthed them. The
principle that apparently governs Tibetan
obsequies is the desirability of making a
corpse fulfil its natural function as food for
animals. Hence exposure of corpses as food
for wolves or vultures causes them no pang.
They even, it is said, so far elaborate the
above principle as to regard a corpse as
specially honoured when given as food to
the domestic pig, the origin of this development
of the principle being of course really
utilitarian; for the high-placed Tibetan, since
in his life he 'feeds high and lives soft,' must
of necessity in his death be specially nutritious.
Lama-fed pork is&mdash;so they say&mdash;regarded as
the greatest of delicacies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving Dochen and the lake, on the
bank of which it lies, we turned up a valley
to our left, and emerged at Kalatso, the name
given to the post which adjoins the lake of
the same name. From here we marched
along the Kalatso plain to Menza. The
next day was to bring us into Kangma.</p>

<p>My commanding officer was with the
first column, and had given me orders to
ride on early on alternate days to meet him
at the camp ahead of me before he left the
latter. His hour for leaving each such camp
would be 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, by which hour I had to
arrive there. I had to bring a sergeant with
me on each occasion. It was fifteen miles
from Menza to Kangma. The road was
rather rough, so they said, but one could
cover the distance in two hours and a half, so
I decided to start with the sergeant at half-past
six. At a quarter-past six I found that
my pony had bruised a fetlock against a
stone in the night and was distinctly lame.
I could not get another mount, and had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
share the sergeant's, and we had little more
than our two hours and a half for the journey.
It so happened that I had just been reading
a story of primitive life in Western America,
called 'The Little Shepherd of Kingdom
Come,' in which a very sound method by
which two men can travel on one horse is
alluded to. A. starts on horseback at, say,
eight miles an hour, and B. on foot at, say, four
miles. When A. has gone a given distance
he dismounts, ties the horse to the nearest
tree or stone, and proceeds on foot. Up in
due course comes B., mounts the horse, and,
riding on, should overtake A. just when A.
has finished his fair share of walking; after
which the process is repeated to the end of
the journey.</p>

<p>I was A. and the sergeant was B. The
road was quite deserted, and the part through
which we were going was at that time
reported quite peaceful, so there was practically
no risk in leaving the pony alone for
short spells at a time. It was a most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
comfortable arrangement altogether. We
travelled at the average rate of six miles
an hour. Each of us had a pleasant ride
alternating with a pleasant walk. Even the
pony, though, when on the move, kept going
pretty hard, yet had pleasant breathers between
whiles. We arrived punctually at
8.55 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, of course to find that the first
column had decided to halt a day at Kangma,
and that therefore there need not have been
any hurry. But then, of course, that is always
the way in such cases.</p>

<p>We had one great adventure just before
we reached Kangma. I had been walking,
and the sergeant had just caught me up, on
the pony, when two shots rang out. I
located them as coming from a village a
short way off. The sergeant affirmed that
they were both volleys. I was in a beastly
funk, and perhaps the sergeant was not
altogether unmoved. Just then two mounted
infantrymen, fully armed, rode up from the
Kangma direction. I have great respect for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
mounted infantrymen, but I have known them
spin yarns. We asked whether there were
any of the enemy about, to which they replied
that their name was legion, or words to that
effect, and that they were all around us.
This being so, it did not seem to matter in
which direction we went; so we pushed
on, indulging in the pleasure of each other's
company for the time being (instead of one
riding ahead while the other walked). Shortly
we rounded a corner, and another shot rang
out, followed by the appearance of two more
mounted infantrymen. We asked the latter
what the firing was about, and they told us
that the commandant of the donkey corps,
who was just round the next corner with his
donkeys, was making a fine bag of pigeons.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>NAINI: TIBETAN WARFARE</small></h2>

<p>We were all halted a day or two at Kangma.
There was some truth after all in the yarn
of the first two mounted infantrymen whom
we had met on the road, for some of the
enemy had been located not far away, and
a flying column had gone out after them.
The enemy evaded the column successfully,
and the latter returned after no other incident
except the death of a man and one or two
mules from the effects of drinking water
which the brave enemy, ignorant of such
Western vagaries as the Geneva Convention,
had artfully poisoned.</p>

<p>Some unladen mules, of which we stood
in considerable need, were brought in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
same day by a small escort from Gyantse.
They had been fired on <i>en route</i>, and so
everything began to point to the chance of
a bit of fighting in the near future.</p>

<p>From here onwards we amalgamated into
one column, and that first march out of
Kangma was particularly typical of the inconveniences
of a comparatively long column
when marching on a narrow hill-road.
It may seem strange, but was really quite
natural, that our small force with its transport
should occupy five miles of road-way, which
was, I believe, its approximate length, and
to get this five-mile-long serpent to crawl
successfully through the 'Red Idol gorge,'
and later on wriggle over a certain very
narrow, rather ricketty bridge, that barred the
way close to camp, was a matter of many
tedious hours. Horribly cold it was too that
afternoon, as one waited for one's kit to turn
up, the valley just there being a veritable
chimney that drew a terrific draught up from
the Gyantse direction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Our labours were also beginning to
increase somewhat, owing both to the compressed
fodder from India having run out,
and our being no longer in a peaceful region,
where we could procure fodder by contract.
Both at Kangma and here we had to send
out foraging parties. We were still observing
a most courteous attitude towards
the enemy, and were paying the villagers
handsome sums for what fodder we took,
provided any villagers showed themselves.
However, in many cases the villages were
completely deserted.</p>

<p>That afternoon a reconnoitring party of
mounted infantry returned with one man badly
wounded, and the report that the village of
Naini, seven miles ahead, was strongly held
by the enemy. This meant fighting on the
morrow.</p>

<p>On the morrow we marched early to
Naini, and disposed ourselves for battle.
Below the road, and quite out of range from
the village, were some convenient fields of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
young barley, upon which we closed up all
the transport, and removed the loads. We
were dreadfully punctilious at that period of
hostilities about commandeering fodder or
damaging crops, and as soon as the fight
began I remember the late Major Bretherton&mdash;the
chief Supply and Transport officer&mdash;sending
me with a delightfully worded message
to the commandants of transport units
regarding the extent to which their animals
might graze. I was to tell them that, though
all damage to crops was to be rigidly avoided,
yet if by any chance a mule did so far forget
himself as to nibble a blade or two of young
barley, the matter need not on the present
occasion be taken too seriously, as the only
ground available for closing up the transport
was the ground on which that nice young
barley was growing. So while 'all day long
the noise of battle rolled' a hundred feet
above them and two hundred yards away, the
transport animals did themselves 'top-hole'
on the enemy's best young barley; a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
thing too, for they got precious little fodder
when they reached camp that night.</p>

<p>I got a good view of the Naini fight,
seeing most of it in company with the
General's Staff. A portion of the Gyantse
garrison had come out to assist, and peppered
the village and lamasarai from a high
hill above, while our own column enveloped
them from other directions. We made some
fine big holes in their walls, and many a
bee's nest of laymen and fighting monks
was disturbed by a well-directed shell. Later
on came the turn of the infantry at what
must have been unpleasantly close quarters.</p>

<p>The fighting in Tibet was of course, in
one sense, quite a minor matter. But, on
the other hand, it was quite a distinctive kind
of fighting, and, as such, does not deserve to
be ignored. My share in those fights was
mainly that of an interested spectator, and
in this capacity I give my opinion of it.</p>

<p>I should say that for any one who, like
myself, never had to go within a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
distance of the position, there could be no
more gentlemanly way of getting your baptism
of fire than on a Tibetan battlefield.
The jingal, for instance, is a delightful weapon
at that range. Of course, if a jingal bullet
hit you (a heavy rough-hewn thing of about
three inches diameter), it would make a hole
that it would take a lot of surgery to fill up.
But normally, in the latter stages of its flight,
the jingal bullet lets you know it is coming.
Furthermore, except at close range, it is very
inaccurate. So if what you desire on the
battlefield is mild excitement, with the minimum
of risk, I would recommend exposing
yourself to jingal-fire at, say, from six to
twelve hundred yards.</p>

<p>A very different tale would be that of the
fighter in the firing line. Most of the fights
in Tibet involved not only street-fighting but
house-fighting, and this species of fun generally
began immediately after a steep climb of
several hundred feet. I can imagine few
greater physical and moral trials in modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
warfare than that endured by those officers
and men of ours, who, while gasping for
breath after a race up a steep slope in that
rare air, penetrated in small parties first
through narrow streets, then into dingy courtyards,
and lastly into byres and store-rooms and
living-rooms that were generally pitch dark,
not knowing from what hole or corner, or
with what murderous form of clumsy firearm,
they might not at any moment be fired upon
by an unseen foe at close quarters. For the
sake of those who went through this trial
and were not found wanting, Tibetan warfare
should not be despised.</p>

<p>The fight at Naini was waged for many
weary hours. Its spectacular charm had
soon worn off. The juxtaposition of fierce
excitement and deadly boredom is a strange
feature of warfare. There, two hundred
yards away, men were killing one another,
and here were some of us positively yawning!</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, our pride of conquest
somewhat chastened by the pangs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
hunger, we marched onwards to Gyantse.
As we drew nearer we heard what seemed
like a very irregular artillery salute fired by
very drunken gunners in honour of some
personage entitled to a very large number
of guns. It was only the jingals in the
Gyantse-jong firing away at us patiently and
solemnly, in the pious hope that they one day
might hit something. Their main objective
was a ricketty bridge across the Gyantse
river which we had to cross before reaching
our camp. Some jingal bullets did on occasion
fall fairly near the bridge, and one mule
was actually hit in the act of crossing. The
crossing of that bridge took till late into the
night. All the way from Naini the path was
intersected with irrigation nullahs, of which
most were full of water. This caused many
checks, which culminated in the block at the
bridge. The latter began to fall to pieces
before all the transport was over, some
animals occasionally falling off into the water.
The last of the rearguard reached camp
about midnight.</p>

<small>AT GYANTSE: FIGHTING: <ins class="corr" title="period replacedwith colon">FORAGING:</ins>
TIBETAN RELIGIOUS ART</small></h2>

<p>The ten days or so spent at Gyantse were
occupied in fighting, in waiting, through
periodical armistices, for the result of negotiations
which came to nothing, in sightseeing
and in foraging for our present needs,
and for the advance to Lhassa.</p>

<p>The two fights here alluded to were the
taking of Tsechin and the taking of Gyantse-jong.
At the former I again had a front
seat in the stalls, watching the show in
company with the headquarters' Staff, but
had to leave, with some aggravating message
to camp, just as the curtain was rising
on the last act. During that long day, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
the end of which Gyantse-jong was taken,
I saw very little of the fighting till just the
very climax, when certain duties took me to
the village P√°l√°, where the Staff were watching
the final phase. No boredom on this
occasion, but intense excitement. The final
assault on the jong was a sight well worth
remembering, coming as it did at the close
of so tedious an action. The artistic effect
of the Maxim on what one might call spectacular
warfare is, I think, greater than that of
artillery. Shells going off at intervals of
course bring out the tragedy of war by the
awful noise which they make, but the rapid
ping-ping-ping of the Maxim sets your
blood tingling and really excites you. It was
a glorious spectacle, that last assault. The
rush through the breach of those Ghurkhas
and their comrades into that frowning impregnable-looking
jong to the tune of artillery,
dynamite, and Maxims would have appealed
to the veriest man of peace. And as the
jong became ours, the cheer that went up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
from every point where troops and followers
stood in knots, watching the outcome, was a
glorious climax to that long day.</p>

<p>A flying column that followed the retreating
enemy to Dongtse failed to catch
them up, but returned with a fine haul of
useful forage. Foraging had for some time
been the order of the day, except when
fighting interfered with it. The Gyantse
plain is very rich, with villages dotted about
at close intervals, all standing among rich
crops and nominally containing plenteous
stores of what were our staple needs. But
the art of hiding such stores is possessed in
a high degree by the Tibetan. Some officers,
who later on had much practice in foraging,
became experts in finding the hidden store-rooms,
knowing at a glance at what point on
a given wall in an upper chamber the wall
painting ceased to be of a permanent nature,
and was merely a temporary daub concealing
the rough cement and pile of loose unbaked
bricks which blocked the doorway of what,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
after use of crowbar and mallet, proved a
veritable mine of grain or barley flour.</p>

<p>Of course, while at Gyantse, the towns
and lamasarais of Gyantse and Tsechin were
our happiest hunting-grounds. In one lofty
room alone we one day found eight thousand
maunds of barley flour, all neatly bagged and
sealed with a Tibetan official seal, doubtless
a mobilisation reserve of the Tibetan army,
and, alongside of it, another similar room
filled with loose grain to a height which we
could never really explore, since the weight
of the grain made it impossible to open the
door more than an inch or so, from which
small aperture our requirements trickled out
by the mule load. If we had had enough
transport to carry on from Gyantse all the
supplies which we found there, our commissariat
problems would have been easy.</p>

<p>As we foraged on the days following
these fights our way was strewn with corpses.
The warriors from the Kh√°m country, who
formed a large part of the Tibetan army,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
were glorious in death, long-haired giants,
lying as they fell with their crude weapons
lying beside them, and usually with a peaceful,
patient look in their faces. As types of physical
humanity they could not be easily excelled.
I remember one day one of the Kh√°m men,
a prisoner, was helping me to set in order a refractory
watermill stone with which I was trying
to grind wheat into flour. My commanding
officer came to see how I was getting on
and caught sight of the prisoner. He gazed
at him in admiration and then exclaimed:</p>

<p>'By Jove! what a fine corpse he would
make!'</p>

<p>Very brutal of him I thought it was till
I had seen more corpses, and then I realised
the true artistic insight of the remark.</p>

<p>I suppose it would be no more possible
for an ordinary person to do justice
to Gyantse as a sightseer than for any one
who had had no classical education to visit
Rome or Athens in the true academic spirit.
Just as the key to those places lies in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
knowledge of classical history, mythology,
and arch√¶ology, so would the true key to
Gyantse lie in a knowledge of the history of
Buddhism in general, and of the Tibetan
variations of Buddhism in particular. The
main tenets of Buddhist doctrine, as one may
acquire them in a handbook or an occasional
magazine article, afford very little clue to
Tibetan religious art. Buddha himself one
can understand, and one becomes quite to
know and admire the gently supercilious,
ever-smiling expression that is faithfully
caught in every statue and picture of him
which one sees. And one can understand
the motive in exemplifying the variations of
human fortune by pictures of the wheel of
life which show types of all the degrees of
human happiness and unhappiness&mdash;instances
of indescribable tortures at one side of the
wheel, lesser miseries adjoining it, followed
by similar gradations so arranged that as we
go round the circle we come at last to fair
scenes of ideal human bliss. But the application<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
of the same kind of gradation to
deities worshipped, and to the representations
of them given in art, is not so easily understood.
There is a certain highly symmetrical
edifice standing in Gyantse monastery.
The centre of it consists of one huge Buddha
reaching from the ground to the height of,
I should say, one hundred and fifty feet.
Round this are built tiers upon tiers of small
shrines; each tier contains one less shrine
than the tier below it. The shrines are of
equal size, so that the general effect of the
whole edifice is that of a pyramid. You rise
from tier to tier by a narrow hidden staircase.
Each shrine contains one idol. If you start
at a certain point on any of the tiers, and
go round that tier, you will first enter the
shrine of a perfect Buddha, for whom you
will feel at least some reverence. The next
shrine will contain an idol that impresses
you less, and has about it some taint of the
world. The next is a thoroughly worldly
idol, the next is ugly, the next is obviously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
wicked, and the next a demon. The demons
grow in demoniacal qualities till suddenly you
arrive again at the Buddha from whom you
started. The tiers above are all arranged on
the same principle, except that, the number
of shrines decreasing by one in each case,
the gradation from Buddha to demon grows
more abrupt as you ascend.</p>

<p>Then again, in the most holy of spots,
not only in Gyantse but even, for instance, in
the audience hall in the sacred 'Pot√°-L√†,'
or palace-monastery of Lhassa, one comes
across images of what to European eyes
appears the lewdest character, and similar
representations are constantly found on the
painted scrolls, which everywhere are seen
hanging in the monasteries.</p>

<p>Such strange excrescences on the external
face of a religion that ranks so high
in regard to the spirituality of its essential
tenets, and the extent and depth of its
influence on human life, as does Buddhism,
seem only to point to the endless intertwinings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
of religions that must ever have been in
process since the world began. Here we
have, for instance, one of the noblest and
purest of religions tainted&mdash;at any rate as
regards the art which is ancillary to it&mdash;with
those twin poisons of demon-worship and
priapism; all contact with which one would
have imagined it to have been pure enough
and strong enough to throw off centuries
ago.</p>

<p>That strange similarity on less essential
points that exists between religions which are
far removed from each other, both in history
and in doctrine, makes one long to read
some really comprehensive history of human
religion that will, by dipping down into the
furthest depths of the past, reveal to us the
answer to such problems as, for instance, the
strong and apparently family likeness between
the joss-sticks and tallow altar-lamp of the
Buddhist, and the incense and wax-candle of
ornate Christian ritual.</p>

<p>Though it would appear that what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
barbaric may survive, in the form of ritual,
as an acknowledged and in some cases, it
may be, even a helpful adjunct to a religion
which in every other respect has cast off all
that is barbarous, yet some of those demons
and those licentious pictures that we saw in
Tibet seemed to the Western mind altogether
too vile to be thus explained away.</p>

<p>But, even so, what fool shall rush in and
criticise the East?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE START FOR LHASSA: A DIGRESSION
ON SUPPLY AND TRANSPORT</small></h2>

<p>Suddenly the order came that we were to
march to Lhassa forthwith. Who should
and who should not form the Lhassa column
must have been a difficult question to
settle. To perform invidious tasks of this
sort must be the most trying feature of
generalship. It would be hard to find an
occasion on any expedition when, to the
individual soldier, going on seemed to mean
so much, and staying behind so little. Forbidden
cities are so fascinating, and the idea
of assisting in drawing aside a pardah so
appeals to our rude imaginations, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
desire to reach Lhassa was especially great.
Those high passes in front of us, the shores
of the great Palti lake and the upper
Brahmaputra, that we knew not how we
should cross, all seemed also to point to
a varied adventure, and there was a spice
of excitement in the thought of marching
through a country, on the resources of which
we should have largely to maintain ourselves,
while as yet we knew hardly anything of
their kind and extent.</p>

<p>We left the sad Gyantse garrison behind
us, and marched off one morning in threatening
weather that soon turned to rain, our path
for the first few miles lying across a veritable
bog. We consisted of the whole of a British
and a section of a native mountain battery,
of a wing of the Royal Fusiliers, of two
companies of mounted infantry (drawn from
various native regiments, and consisting of
Sikhs, Ghurkhas, and Pathans) of the 8th
Ghurkha Rifles, several companies of the
32nd Sikh Pioneers and the 40th Pathans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
one company of Sappers and Miners, and two
machine gun detachments. Several field
hospitals or sections of field hospitals accompanied
us, besides, of course, many other
miscellaneous necessities such as ammunition
column, treasure, supply column, post-office,
veterinary establishment, and field park.
The telegraph department was conspicuous
by its absence, it being a feature of the advance
to Lhassa that we left the telegraph
behind at Gyantse&mdash;a proceeding which
doubtless had both its inconvenient and its
convenient results. Last but not least came
the transport. One may divide this into
regular and irregular. The regular transport
consisted of the whole or portions of
five Indian mule corps, the 6th, the 7th,
the 9th, the 10th, and the 12th; the irregular
of a cooli corps, and two locally
raised corps&mdash;one of yaks and the other
of donkeys.</p>

<p>Our transport was so big an item and so
big a necessity that a short sketch of it as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
ploughed through the sodden fields outside
Gyantse that wet July morning may not come
amiss.</p>

<p>The average Indian transport pack mule,
aged probably fifteen to eighteen years old,
is the finest old soldier we have got. If, like
Lord Roberts's gray arab, he were allowed to
record his services round his neck, he would
display a fine collection of medals and clasps.
Allowing that he is now fifteen and that he
joined the ranks ten years ago, and allowing
as a general principle that where a frontier
expedition of any size takes place the bulk of
the regular mule transport of the army in
India is required for it, we can take it that at
the age of six he had a rough breaking-in to
war conditions in Chitral; that, after a year
or so of peace, he carried convoy stores or
troops' baggage over many weary marches in
the Malakand or the Tochi valley, or in
Tirah. In 1900, as likely as not, he was
entrained one hot midsummer day, carried off
to Calcutta, and shipped to China. As an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
alternative he may have been wanted in South
Africa. Later on he very probably served in
the Mahsud blockade. Between whiles he has
had a few spells of cantonment life, but has
probably spent his hot weathers daily carrying
the needful water supply up to some hill
station, perched on a hilltop, from a reservoir
two thousand feet below, and a portion of his
cold weathers in the feverish sham warfare of
man&oelig;uvres. All the time he has preserved
the same dogged, cheery temperament, getting
out of the train at the base of an expedition,
seeing there the familiar sights that portend
field service, then having a good roll in the
dust, getting up and shaking himself, as though
to say, 'Here we are again,' like the clown in
the pantomime; or plodding along through
rain or snow or hot weather duststorm with
two maunds on his back, and only wondering
casually what will be the next practical joke
which his masters will perpetrate on him.
His is a rough lot, but he takes it kindly, and
with good grain and fodder is not unhappy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>The mule driver also is a man of parts.
Compare him with that fine soldier&mdash;the
cavalryman. The former has to feed, groom,
fit and clean the gear of, and sometimes
forage for, three or four animals instead of
one, as is the case of the latter. Further,
the cavalryman mounts his beast, while the
mule driver marches on foot.</p>

<p>The case of the mule and his attendant
came before the Government of India a few
years ago, who decided to improve their status.
They have since accomplished a great deal
by introducing an organised corps system
among Indian transport. The system was
worked experimentally for some years, and
is now an authorised and accomplished
fact. The mule and his driver, instead of,
as was formerly the case, being no men's
children in particular, belong to their troop,
to their subdivision, and to their corps. Every
corps is distinguishable by its uniform, and is
commanded by a British officer, who has
under him his own permanent subordinate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
staff, and who is responsible for the well-being
and efficiency of all the men and beasts
in his charge.</p>

<p>The enhancement of efficiency and well-being,
and, perhaps more than all, of the
personal self-respect of the individual driver,
which has been the result both of the new
organised discipline and of the new <i>esprit de
corps</i>, is very marked. It remains only to
prove conclusively that in the field, the inter-organisation
of transport can be sufficiently
maintained to serve its object, without interfering
with other military considerations.
The allotting of their transport to combatant
units, according to their exact requirements,
without destroying the organisation of the
transport units themselves, often constitutes
a problem which a chief transport officer
has difficulty in solving. The <i>via media</i>,
which on this Expedition has afforded a solution,
has been to let the transport organisation,
if necessary, go to the winds on the
march itself, but to give it the first claim<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
to consideration when once a column has
reached camp.</p>

<p>Those irregular corps which supplemented
the permanent military pack transport were
most indispensable but delightfully heterogeneous.
It may be interesting to describe
the journey of, say, a maund of rice from
Siliguri to Lhassa on these various forms of
transport. Wrapped in its waterproof to
keep off the rain torrents, the rice was
dumped into a bullock-cart at Siliguri. If
the road did not collapse from a landslip at
any awkward moment and so drop the bullock-cart
and its contents <i>en masse</i> into the
Teesta river&mdash;a not infrequent occurrence&mdash;the
rice-bag probably reached Rangpo.
From there it probably proceeded for a few
marches on the back of a pack bullock, a
patient beast who moved slowly, and whose
feet in that damp climate got very tender,
and on those stony paths very sore. Later
on it reached steep gradients where the pack
bullock could no longer carry it, and it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
handed over for several marches to a cooli.
The cooli would be a native of some hill
district of India (Panch, for instance, or
Darjiling). He and the comrades to whom
he passed it on would take it over either the
Jalap-L√† or the Natu-L√†, down into the
Chumbi valley. From here a pack mule
or an 'irregular' pack pony would take it
up to Ph√°ri. From here across the Ph√°ri
plain through Tuna and Kalatso and as
far as Menza it would lie in an ekka, for
this was flat country, and it had seemed
worth while and eventually proved a signal
success to drag up from India several hundred
of those plainly built but strong little
two-wheeled carts called ekkas, which hold
five maunds each, and can be used on almost
any road, however rough, provided it is wide
enough to hold both wheels. These ekkas
had been run up behind their ponies as far as
possible, then taken to pieces, and carried in
fragments on the backs of coolis over the
passes and up on to the Ph√°ri plain, where, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
a height of 15,000 feet, they were put together
again and plied to and fro, at first greatly to the
astonishment of the resident Tibetan, who
had never seen any wheels other than prayer-wheels.
Most of the ekkas were drawn by
ponies of the small 'country-bred' type
brought from India, but the casualties among
these were sometimes replaced by draught
yaks.</p>

<p>From Menza onwards our rice-bag had
a choice of mounts. It might go on a pack
mule, or meander slowly along on the back of
a pack yak, or, with the other bag alongside
it, entirely eclipse from human view the most
miniature of donkeys, who, nevertheless, if
allowed ample time to look about him, and to
pick up weird grazing by the roadside, would
eventually arrive in camp none the worse,
and with his load intact after a uniform
progress of about one mile an hour.</p>

<p>On one or other of these animals the rice-bag
would eventually reach Lhassa, or, if it
foregathered with the Lhassa column on its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
way up, it might be handed over to one of
the coolis who accompanied that column.
It probably reached Lhassa intact, its waterproof
bag having protected it from all
weathers; but it might also have got a small
hole somewhere among its ample coverings,
and lost a pound or two on the way, or&mdash;for
such is human nature&mdash;arrive still weighing
the original eighty pounds, but containing
a stone or two in the place where some
few odd pounds of rice ought to have been.</p>

<p>The manners and customs of our various
transport animals would form an interesting
study in natural history. The yak, to the
uninitiated intruder, was of course the most
striking. The mule we know, and the donkey
we know, and the cooli was more or less of the
same species as ourselves; but the yak was a
novelty. The yak is a buffalo in petticoats.
This seems an incongruous combination, for
the <i>√† priori</i> idea of a buffalo is of something
fierce, and of petticoats, of something not
fierce. But in this case petticoat influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
has altogether prevailed, for the yak is the
mildest natured of animals. He moves very
slowly, takes life very quietly, and is content
with little here below, or rather here above,
for if you take him below 9,000 feet he pines
for the heights. I believe he is really at
his cosiest when lying in a snowdrift on a
winter's day with his petticoats around him
and only his horns showing. He then feels
really well tucked up.</p>

<p>Both yaks and donkeys were very cheap
forms of transport. It is true that yaks had
a way of dying and donkeys of deserting,
but even so their initial cost was very small,
they needed very few drivers in proportion
to their numbers, and possessed the art
of living on the country. An animal that
along a line of communications of some
four hundred miles' length, and lying in an
inhospitable country, neither asks you to
bring him up fodder or even grain from the
base, nor yet expects you to go foraging for
him, is indeed a treasure.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>The yak and donkey drivers were
Tibetans, as also were many of the hospital
ambulance carriers. The most noticeable
points about these Tibetans were that they
were inveterate gamblers, and were also very
much married. The idea of accompanying
us without their womenkind was quite foreign
to them, and we had to accede to their
prejudices in the matter. Merry little souls
those women mostly were. Their foreheads
and noses usually smeared with that pigment
of sows' blood which proclaims to the world
the Tibetan woman's chastity, they were
ever to be seen laughing or chaffing one
another, either on the march or else in camp,
over their domestic duties or their knitting.
Their stocking-knitting was of a high order,
except that the art of 'turning a heel' was
unknown to them.</p>

<p>I remember passing a knot of them one
day as we climbed one of the worst passes that
we had to encounter on the march&mdash;a climb
of four thousand feet without a break. Hill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
people know better than any one the advantage
of breathing rhythmically, and the
Tibetan loves to acquire this rhythm by singing
over any work that strains him at all.
Tibetan men and women, as they thresh their
corn with the flail, chant pretty ditties in
unison, and Tibetan boatmen on the Sangpo
will sometimes sing to their work. And here
was this band of women singing cheerily as
they climbed that mountain side, and never
pausing in their song. They were well up
with the advance guard too, and the chorus
could be heard all down the column&mdash;a
novel sort of band with which to cheer a
British army onwards on a toilsome march!</p>

<p>The cooli too, especially he who hied
from the hinterland of Darjiling, was as
merry a soul as you meet on a day's march.
Some were quite boys, not more than sixteen,
yet the way they shouldered their loads was
wonderful. The regulation load was eighty
pounds, but I have often seen quite a youngster
with a hundred pounds on his back, taking it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
steadily along up thousands of feet, and
taking it as a matter of course, and giving
you a grinning greeting as you passed him.
When off duty, they would be for ever skipping
about like mountain goats, skylarking,
and pulling one another about. The supervising
staff of Ghurkhas, too, all had the jolly
Ghurkha face. For a cheery family party it
would be hard to beat that cooli corps.</p>

<p>But that Lhassa column with its train of
transport has got well out of the bog by now,
and it behoves us to overtake it.</p>

<small>TO RALUNG: MORE SUPPLY MATTERS:
A VISIT TO A MONASTERY</small></h2>

<p>From Gyantse to Ralung is a steady upward
incline, and took us three days. It rained
most of the time, both day and night; it was
difficult to get dry again when once you were
wet, and there was a good deal of discomfort
experienced in all quarters. One camping
ground was particularly unpleasant, which
for the most part consisted of ploughed land
that was not only soaking with the rain, but
had recently been irrigated. As we had
risen considerably higher than the Gyantse
plain, the crops on this and similar ground
had hardly begun to show. In fact, from
here onwards for many days to come, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
seemed very little chance of obtaining any
grazing for our animals. We had taken all
the transport we could, and loaded it with as
many supplies as possible, all selected according
to our known needs on the one hand, and
the possible but unknown resources of the
country on the other; but even so our prospects
were not rosy. The mule, for instance,
cannot live on grain alone: he must have
fodder, and one mule in a very few days will
consume as much fodder as is equivalent in
weight to his own authorised load. Hence,
if you provide a mule with a reserve of fodder
to last him that number of days and make
him carry it, you might just as well leave
him behind, since he will then be able to
carry nothing else except his own fodder.
This, in a country where fodder is not
locally procurable, is, at any rate in the case
of the pack mule, one of the great problems
of army transport, and we were brought face
to face with it more than once during this
march. Grain too is heavy stuff, or, in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
words, gets quickly consumed. We used
over two hundred maunds a day, or more
than a hundred mule loads, and so could not
start our march with many days' supply in
reserve without excluding other things that
also had to be carried. The next heaviest
item was tsampa (the Tibetan barley flour
which we were now using as a substitute
for the '√°ta' or coarsely ground wheat flour
usually consumed by natives). Of this we
used seventy maunds daily, and so had only
a few days in reserve. Meat, though a large
item, is much more tractable stuff, for it walks
on its four feet till you kill it. It can even be
of use in carrying other things. For instance,
we had made up our minds that, if sheep and
cows ran short, we would eat each yak that,
on account of the depletion of supplies, had
no longer a load to carry! The other items
of food, though many of them costly and
highly essential, were none of them very
bulky, and of these we had been able to
bring along some weeks' reserve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>Our more pressing needs were therefore
confined to fodder and grain and tsampa,
and many were the foraging parties that
went forth on arrival in camp, or that made
a detour from the line of march in search of
these articles, some drawing blank, some
getting very little, and some occasionally a
fair haul. At Ralung we got a fair haul.
There is a very fine monastery there, situated
up a valley five miles from where we camped.
I remember spending a very pleasant afternoon
there. I had gone there, immediately
after arriving in camp, with my commanding
officer to see what could be got out of the place.
We found some whole barley, some tsampa,
and a fair stock of straw. My commanding
officer left me there to await the necessary
transport while he went back to camp to send
it. I really had a very pleasant time, being
hospitably entertained both by the monks
and also the nuns&mdash;especially the latter.
They brought me out 'chang' to drink, a
home-brewed light wine, made I believe from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
barley, and the carcass of a sheep that had
been cooked whole, and from which you were
expected to pick off your individual requirements.
It had already had a lot taken from
it, and from a certain self-assertiveness that
there was about it, I concluded that it had
been a standing dish for a considerable
period, and contented myself with my own
sandwiches. Then they came and talked to
me through the interpreter whom I had with
me, and quite a youthful little nun in a
picturesque woolly red cap came and sat
beside me and did her knitting. My overcoat
had been wet through for three days,
and the sun coming out gave me a chance of
drying it. Quite warm and cosy it all was,
with ladies' society and all thrown in. I was
quite sorry when, after several hours of
waiting, a long serpent-shaped line of mules
slowly trailed up the valley and came for the
grain, the tsampa, and the straw.</p>

<p>We were paying again for what we foraged,
and I remember doling out what must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
seemed to the recipients a prodigious number
of rupees. Tibetan monasteries are undeniably
rich, but, especially in outlying parts, I
fancy they do all their buying and selling in
kind. For instance, they collect their taxes
in kind, and it is certainly feasible for them to
obtain labour, clothing, and such necessaries
without having recourse to coin. The fact
that the average Lama was unused to dealing
in large sums of money seemed to always
have one of two opposite effects. He either
did not seem to grasp the fact that a large
sum of money really represented 'articles of
value,' and had no desire whatever to part
with any of his possessions in exchange for
it, or else, being either less ignorant and
knowing its value, or more simple-minded
and attracted by its glitter, he would accept
the money with pronounced greed.</p>

<p>The effect of all the coin that we took to
and left in the country must have had a
curious economic effect on Tibet. For a
country that trades largely by barter to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
suddenly flooded with rupees should, according
to the ordinary principles of political
economy, raise the current prices of all commodities
to an extraordinary extent. However,
Tibet, queer country that it is, has
probably a political economy all of its very
own, and will arrange such a matter entirely
differently from Western expectation.</p>

<p>Even our rupees, as such, were not
always approved, a distinction being sometimes
drawn between those enfaced with
King Edward's head and those enfaced with
Queen Victoria's. The latter were approved
on the ground that they were 'Kampani'
rupees, the Queen's face being apparently
regarded as the trade mark of the East India
Company, of which the past generation of
Tibetans must have heard and passed on the
memory to their children, who still thought it
was in existence. A new symbol, such as that
of a man's head, was thus naturally viewed
at first with suspicion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>THE KARO-L√Ä</small></h2>

<p>The next day brought us just under the
Karo-L√† pass, and we camped at a height of
16,600 feet, with a great mass of snow so
near us on the hillside that, while the sun
was still up, it quite hurt our eyes to look in
that direction. Avalanches of snow kept
falling from the mass, coming down with a
great thud that was almost startling. There
was a little mountain sickness that night; but,
considering the height and the fatigue that
had been involved in reaching it, there was
remarkably little. A very little reconnoitring
to the front in the early afternoon had
revealed the enemy in position a mile or so
the other side of the pass. They had built<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
two walls, one behind the other, on what
appeared to be admirably selected ground.
They seemed in fact to have been studying
tactics to some purpose.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to get up the next morning
in a sharp frost, and to get, as it were, one
glimpse into winter&mdash;a glimpse, however, that
only lasted till the sun got up. Cold for the
past few months had not been our bugbear, but
rain, and to-day there was no rain, the sky
was cloudless, and the air crisp and fresh,
and as soon as the sun was up, even moderately
warm.</p>

<p>A few minutes' walk took us to the top of
the pass, 16,800 feet. From there the road
descended gradually, but the headquarters'
Staff, whom for the moment I was accompanying,
kept to the hillside at the same level as
the top of the pass till they came to a good
<i>coin de vantage</i> from which to view the first
phase of the fight. For it was obvious that
we were to be opposed.</p>

<p>The artillery stayed close by us, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
two parties of Ghurkhas were sent to scale
the heights on either side, and the Fusiliers
and some more infantry sent along the valley
to attack the formidable-looking walls which
the Tibetans had erected ahead of us.</p>

<p>It soon appeared that the enemy had
decided at the last to leave the two walls
down in the valley, behind either of which
they could have assuredly made a useful
stand, and had instead betaken themselves to
the top of an almost inaccessible ridge overlooking
the walls and about two thousand
feet above them, on what was to us the right
side of the valley. From near the top of this
ridge a jingal soon began firing, and kept up
an intermittent cannonade for several hours.
Our artillery fired a great many rounds in
that direction, but it was difficult to ascertain
what effect they had. It was apparent that
the brunt of the fighting during this phase of
the action would fall upon the right party of
Ghurkhas, who now in the distance, as they
climbed steadily up the steep cliffs to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
right front, looked like a string of tiny ants.
They must have climbed two to three thousand
feet before they reached the ridge, and
thus gone into action at a height bordering on
20,000 feet. Before they could get near the
enemy they had to cross a steep strip of
snow. Ploughing through that within range
of the enemy must have been somewhat
trying. They got near them at last and
accounted for a good many, including, it was
afterwards ascertained, two important leaders.
The ridge on which the Tibetans made their
stand contained several caves, in which the
enemy proceeded to hide, so that what followed
must have been a species of ratting,
which resulted in the capture of a good many
prisoners.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the rest of our forces moved
onwards, and the 40th Pathans were at
length sent in pursuit of several of the enemy
who were seen escaping upwards in the direction
of a glacier, while the artillery from
their new position kept the latter moving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
with a few rounds of shrapnel. After a lot
of ammunition, breath, and muscular tissue
had been expended in this uphill pursuit,
there was no sign left anywhere of the enemy
on or below the skyline. They had apparently
disappeared over the glacier.</p>

<p>We were then ready to march to camp.
After a very short distance we passed Zara,
a small village alongside of which is a
Chinese rest-house. Close to the village we
came upon our enemy's camp standing as
they had left it in the morning. We got
from it a good deal of tsampa and found
more in the village itself, where they had
evidently stored their reserve of this, their
only article of food. We were in need of
firewood too, and found a lot of useful logs
lying about the camping ground, not to
mention a large number of tent poles made
of good seasoned wood, which burnt well
that night in our own camp.</p>

<p>We camped about five miles further on,
and about a thousand feet lower down. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
descend into a somewhat more plentiful air was
a relief after a night and a day on the Karo-L√†.</p>

<p>Our great difficulty that night was the
lack of fodder. The mules had had a long
day and no grazing, and there was not a blade
of anything to give them. We did the best
we could by doling out an extra pound of
grain per animal, which was issued, after a
long soaking, in small quantities at frequent
intervals. This helped to fill the gaps left
by the lack of fodder. A weed resembling
vetch with a small purple flower grew on the
hillside. We also cut some of this and
gave it to the mules, who ate some of it, but
on the whole preferred any loose ends of
their next-door neighbours' jules or blankets.
There was a great deal of woollen texture
consumed that night, and some of the jules
were a sorry sight in the morning.</p>

<p>The noise made at night by hungry mules
who have no fodder is very distressing. That
night they kept up a constant complaining.</p>

<small>NAGARTSE: ENVOYS: DEMOLITIONS: BATHS:
BOILING WATER
</small></h2>

<p>Next day we reached Nagartse. This is a
village surmounted by a jong which is perched
at the end of a rocky ridge which runs from
higher hills close down to a corner of the
Lake Palti. There is one monastery inside
the jong itself, and another on the hillside
close by. There was a belt of standing crops
close to the jong which were more advanced
than those on the other side of the Karo-L√†.
On the whole we appeared to have reached
something of an oasis. If the enemy had
decided to make a stand against us here, we
should have had very little difficulty in ousting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
them. It would have been quite easy to
send our mountain guns up on to the ridge
above the jong, and a very few shells from
that position would have probably secured a
speedy evacuation. As a matter of fact,
after a little parleying, they decided to evacuate,
and we were to be free of the jong and
all it contained, while of course we respected
all property of theirs that pertained to
religion.</p>

<p>From here onwards we were constantly
met by deputations of envoys. The sight,
which first of all used greatly to tickle the
fancy, of important Tibetan personages under
bright umbrellas and riding splendid mules
splendidly caparisoned, and led by servants in
gorgeous liveries, soon grew quite <ins class="corr" title="missing period inserted">common.</ins>
At every point of any importance along the
line of our advance, this or a similar cavalcade
would come hurrying up. What exactly
used to take place at the interviews which
followed, I am not privileged to know, but
apparently fresh reasons were advanced on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
each occasion for our not going further on
our way to Lhassa, and fresh specious
promises of considering our demands in a
conciliatory though vague spirit were never
wanting. But after a pleasant talk of many
hours the purple and fine linen used to ride
away baffled.</p>

<p>We halted at Nagartse for two nights.
We found it a useful place to have captured.
Unfortunately it contained little grain, of
which now we were growing very short, but
we found in it a large storehouse of bagged
tsampa, which was very welcome. It proved
also to have been used by the enemy as an
arsenal, and several boxes of gunpowder
were discovered in it, hidden away in a barn
among quantities of straw. We had grown
wary in searching jongs since the day, a
fortnight or so before, when some accident
such as a lighted match falling through a
flooring in Gyantse-jong had caused the
explosion of a store of gunpowder which had
done much havoc among a party of Fusiliers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
close by, several of whom had been seriously
injured.</p>

<p>The gunpowder found at Nagartse was
destroyed by us, and certain portions of
the buildings demolished, the latter process
producing a fine haul of firewood in the
shape of the beams and rafters of the
demolished houses. That process of demolition,
in which the Sappers and Miners were
past masters, is one of the dirtiest jobs I
know. I was there to collect wood from the
<i>d√©bris</i>, which the Sappers and Miners demolished.
As each wall falls it throws up
a cloud of dust, and the filth of ages in small
particles enters your eyes, your ears, your
hair, and your mouth, and covers your clothes:
no small matter when the clothes in which
you stand may be the only suit you possess,
and the function of having a bath cannot be
undertaken lightly, but needs due warning,
ample preparation, and assured leisure.</p>

<p>Many of us who serve in India have, for
considerations of health, which to the Englishman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
at home seem absurd, but are nevertheless
proved by Anglo-Indian experience to
be imperative, had to abjure the cold bath.
For such a hot bath is the only form of
complete ablution. Your tent, if you do
not exceed your scale of transport, will be
small and will have no bath-room attached;
then for preparing the bath, you have to
remove all the ordinary contents of the tent
outside into the open. Then will follow the
setting in position of whatever form of camp
bath you may possess, or may be able to
borrow. Meanwhile an extra allowance of
firewood has to be procured and the water
made hot. By the time all is ready and
you are beginning to take off your clothes
a considerable time will have passed. If,
during that period, some exigency of field
service does not arise which requires you to
leave all those preparations regretfully, and
postpone the bath to another day, you are
lucky. Even if you get through with your
project without being disturbed, it is as likely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
as not that the day for getting your clothes
washed being a movable feast, you will have
nothing to put on that will not seem a
defilement to your freshly polished skin.
Getting water hot enough was sometimes
difficult when you wanted as much as is
necessary for a bath, if the wind blew high
and firewood was scanty. But this was
nothing compared with the difficulty experienced
in such forms of cookery as were
associated with boiling water. The temperature
at which water boils at an altitude of,
say, 15,000 feet is, I believe, some forty
degrees lower than boiling point on the sea-level.
I wondered for a long time why my
tea never seemed to have been made with
boiling water, and I am afraid a certain
faithful youth who used to make it for me
got rather harsh treatment till my scientific
education was sufficiently advanced to absolve
him. Tea that is served up at a temperature
of forty degrees below the normal
boiling point can never be very nice. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
it got cool very quickly, which of course was
natural. When I returned to India the other
day, I could not make out why I was always
burning my tongue over my tea, till I remembered
that of course the tea which I
was now drinking was made with water that
boiled at an ordinary boiling temperature,
and so remained too hot to drink till it had
been allowed to stand for a decent interval.</p>

<p>It was in its effect upon rice as part of
the natives' ration that this low boiling point
was really of serious import. Rice well
boiled is a good ration for natives, but there
was many a case of indigestion and colic
attributed to the rice which had been spuriously
boiled at one of these high altitudes,
but never really cooked.</p>

<small>LAKE PALTI: DRAWING BLANK: <ins class="corr" title="original had: PETI-JONG">PETE-JONG</ins></small></h2>

<p>We left Nagartse in very wretched weather,
and for the next few days marched in rain
and camped in rain. A spell of bad weather
like this, bad enough as it is for every one,
man or beast, is perhaps worst of all for the
mules who carry the tents, for a thoroughly
soaked tent is literally twice its normal weight;
and ours on this occasion, after the initial
soaking, got no drier for several days in
succession.</p>

<p>We were now marching alongside the
Lake Palti. Once or twice the clouds broke
for an hour or so, and the sun and sky lit up
the lake, and so showed it us in its true colour&mdash;that
unique shade of turquoise, unlike anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
in water scenery that the most travelled of us
had ever seen before. I forget whether any
scientific explanation of the peculiar colour
was forthcoming among the learned, but
the water of the lake being distinctly brackish
may contain certain salts which, being
diluted throughout the whole extent of the
lake, produces some faint effect of colour on
the water, and this, in combination with the
sky's reflection, results in the turquoise shade
which we so admired.</p>

<p>The Tibetans, with that large-mindedness
which characterises their disposal of their
dead, do not forget the fishes of the Lake
Palti, and in that region corpses are made
away with by being thrown into the lake.</p>

<p>It would thus appear that, what with its
salts and functions as a cemetery, the lake
supplied but indifferent drinking water. At
one or two camps that we occupied by its
side, there were no streams flowing down
from the hills, so we had to be content with
the lake, but no ill effects resulted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>Many were the fish that were caught in
Lake Palti, as we skirted its banks, and that
embellished those dinners that were now
getting so plain. The regular trout fishing
appliances&mdash;greenheart rod, reel and silk-spun
line, catgut cast and choice Zulu or
March-brown fly&mdash;accounted for large numbers;
but side by side with the sportsman so
equipped would stand some sepoy or follower
with a lengthy stick, a bit of string, and a bent
pin baited with a bit of tsampa, whose efforts
would be crowned with success quite similar.
Really accommodating fish those were, that
gave the skilled angler the entertainment he
sought, and yet did not disdain that humbler
one who with simpler devices fished only for
the pot.</p>

<p>Yasig was our first camp out of Nagartse.</p>

<p>There was a village two miles from camp,
but it contained no supplies, and was deserted
except for a few old women. In those days,
to the casual traveller through Tibet, old
women would have appeared to form the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
bulk of the population. A useful thing, an
old woman! You can use her as a cat's-paw.
Though afraid to go yourself into the
vicinity of the invading foe, you can yet
send your old woman to watch over your
interests in the village, to feed and milk the
cows that you have left hidden there, to
perform such small agricultural functions
generally as may save the farm from utter
ruin, and to return periodically with the
latest news of the foe. That seemed to be
the idea which dominated the Tibetans in
this matter, and perhaps it was a sound one.
I can certainly imagine no more effective
'chowkidar' upon a village than an ancient,
toothless, slatternly Tibetan woman, who
greets you with tongue out and thumbs
upturned (the conventional symbols of submission),
and weeps long and loud from the
moment you approach her until you leave
her. I believe Aristotle has defined tragedy
as 'a purging of the emotions with sympathy
and a kind of horror.' According to this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
definition the sight of these old women was
essentially tragic. You went to a village
hoping to find in it a stock of good things,
and you found only this old woman and
nothing else. You were sorry for the old
girl, of course; but when you saw the filth
encasing her and the lice enveloping her,
you were filled indeed with 'a kind of horror,'
and rode away promptly with your emotions
thoroughly purged after the correct Aristotelian
method. The Tibetan of course knew
that this would happen, and this was why he
sent his old woman to guard his property.</p>

<p>We hoped not to draw blank at the next
halt, for here we came to the village Pete,
surmounted by Pete-jong, an important landmark
on our route. But now we began to
discover that some one had stolen a march
on us, and was looting ahead of us. It
appeared that, of the army that had opposed
us at the Karo-L√†, one portion had disappeared
over the glacier, but that another
was in retreat towards Lhassa, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
feeding itself somewhat ruthlessly on the
country as it went. From reports that
reached us, it appeared also that the paymasters
of the Tibetan army regarded their
duties lightly, and that the force in front of
us, consisting mainly of mercenaries, had no
compunction in looting not only the bare
means of subsistence, but also any supplementary
stores which by a generous calculation
might seem equivalent in value to the
arrears of their pay. Even so it was not so
much what they took that spoilt our chance
of finding stores to purchase, as the fact that
each act of looting on their part at once
became known in all the villages ahead, with
the result that stores of all kinds, but
especially grain and tsampa, were being
hidden away from the reach of either the
Tibetan army or ourselves with the utmost
possible despatch. Hence our prospects
again became far from rosy. There was
fortunately some grazing at Pete-jong for the
animals, but both grain and tsampa were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
growing short. A day or two more, without
some addition of these articles, would see us
depleted.</p>

<p>Pete-jong, a fine square-topped fort, built
on a rock, overtopped by high mountains
on one side, and overlooking the blue waters
of Lake Palti on the other, looked magnificent,
and more than ever reminded one of
that drop-scene in the theatre. 'What a
shame,' my wife says, 'to draw such horrid
comparisons!' But I tell her they are not
horrid really. In fact, a short sojourn in
Tibet, a country freed from the obscurities
of a thick atmosphere, and full of great
dense mountains and lakes, and of startlingly
crude contrasts of bright colours, quite revolutionises
for the time being one's ideas
of landscape art. In one of those diffident
modern impressionist pictures, in which the
artist is afraid to make his sky or water
really blue, or his snow really white, or his
mountain-tops really lofty or distinct, one
finds nothing that appeals to one's sense of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
vivid truth. But in that drop-scene above
alluded to, lit up as it would be by glaring
footlights, or in that glorious wealth of colour
that is daubed by machinery on to even so
low a thing as a tradesman's almanac, or,
again, in that magic lantern slide reflected
on a sheet, which gave to one as a child
such romantic ideas of nature rampant in
Switzerland or the Holy Land, there is more
that represents the clear form and crude
colour of the uplands of Tibet than would
ever be found in the works of any up-to-date
Royal Academician. As memory fades, and
one becomes used again to denser atmospheres
and to features of the earth's surface
that are less pronounced, I suppose one's
ideas will revert to their normal orthodoxy.</p>

<p>Pete-jong, fair and romantic from the outside,
is the reverse within. We left a few
troops there, making it a post on our line of
communication (as we had done also in
the cases of Nagartse and Ralung). I was
sorry for the Pete-jong garrison. The lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
part of the jong was occupied by byres and
barns and dark chambers, all of them empty
of all but filth. Through the centre of the
jong, and through the rock on which it was
built, a rough stone track, half path, half
staircase, ran upwards, mostly in pitch darkness.
From the walls at the side, from the
roof overhead, and from the ground beneath,
moisture seemed to be always exuding,
the walls and roof being all slimy and
musty, while greasy mud oozed perpetually
from the interstices of the stones on the floor.
No sunlight ever reached this dark passage,
so that the moisture could dry no faster than
it was replenished by that hidden spring in
the rock which apparently was its source.
The only suitable habitable rooms were high
up at the top of the jong, and these were
designed as barracks, hospital, store depot,
and post commandant's quarters. But every
time any one went outside the jong from his
quarters, he had to go down this slimy black
artery and return the same way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>After halting one night at Pete-jong the
column marched on in soaking rain to the
foot of the Kamba-L√†. Here we were to
leave Lake Palti and mount the pass that
stood above our camp.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>OVER THE KAMBA-L√Ä: THE LAND OF PROMISE</small></h2>

<p>About a thousand feet of zig-zag climbing
were to bring us to the top of the pass,
where we would again for the moment stand
over 16,000 feet. The morning was fairly
fine, and the clouds high. It took hours, of
course, before our five-mile-long column had
reached the top. We toiled up slowly, many
of us with sad misgivings, for that supply
column in the rear was grievously light,
and its further depletion would mean much
to all of us. To any one whose thoughts
were for official reasons specially driven into
this channel, the moment of arrival at the
cairn that marked the summit of the Kamba-L√†
was perhaps the most critical moment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
the Expedition, if not even its veritable turning
point. Since leaving Gyantse we had
marched through a country that seemed to
grow more and more destitute of the supplies
we needed. Chance had given us an
occasional largess, and here and there we
had lighted upon something of an oasis; but
latterly in places upon which we had set our
hopes we had found nothing. And here we
were leaving even the sparsely cultivated
shores of the Lake Palti, climbing into the
barren mountains, and then descending into
the unknown. But, as that eventful summit
was reached, what a view met our gaze! Beyond
us a deep gully sloped down to a valley
four thousand feet below. The descent for
the first two thousand feet would be over
bare bleak hillside: after that we would
descend across the wood-line, below which
firewood, at any rate (an article for which, in
certain altitudes, yak-dung had often been
substituted), would be found in plenty. And
below that belt of forest, and on either side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
of a broad river, we saw thick green crops
that meant grazing galore, and here and there
among the crops large prosperous-looking
villages, or stately monasteries that should
assuredly be well stocked with grain and
tsampa and other delights. One thought of
Moses when he caught his first glimpse of
the promised land!</p>

<p>Our only fear was of the Tibetan
army fleeing in front of us&mdash;whether they
might not have looted this valley also, and
frightened the inhabitants into hiding all
their stores. But the valley was so large
and prosperous-looking that it seemed certain
that their depredations could not have
affected the whole of it. So we went
down the hill with glad hearts. The first
two villages we passed, as we entered the
main valley, were empty, and for a moment
we were afraid again; but a mile further
on we came upon a large village&mdash;that of
Kamba Baji&mdash;which on inspection proved a
veritable mine of wealth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>We camped for that night beside it, and
spent the afternoon probing its resources.
The Kazi (or headman) of Kamba Baji was
our friend from the first. He gave us all he
had, taking our coin in exchange in the
spirit in which it was offered. He owned a
great deal of land up and down the valley,
and that land and its products both then and
afterwards, he placed ungrudgingly at our
service, even though the rupees which he
received in exchange, albeit generous payment,
hardly compensated him for the annoyance
which, as a substantial country gentleman,
he must have felt at our unwarrantable
intrusion upon his property. Our relations
remained cordial ever afterwards. His
house lay on the road which the escort to
the post always took between Chaksam and
Pete-jong. For that escort, as they rode up,
two elderly handmaidens of the Kazi's household
were ever found waiting with brimful
jugs of new milk in their arms, with which
to refresh the travellers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>THE CROSSING OF THE TSANGPO:
A SAD ACCIDENT</small></h2>

<p>The following day we marched down the
Tsangpo or Brahmaputra to Chaksam Ferry.
A small column of mounted infantry had
ridden ahead of us and captured the local
flotilla, which consisted of two large rectangular
ferry boats, capable each of holding
about twenty mules, a hundred men, or two
hundred maunds of stores. Each boat was
decorated with a roughly carved figure-head
representing a horse. One horse had lost
one of its ears, which rather detracted from
its otherwise imposing appearance. The
party that had preceded us to capture the
ferry had also, by the time the main column<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
arrived, penetrated the monastery which
overlooked the river, made friends with the
monks, and engaged the services of the local
ferrymen, who all belonged to the monastery.
The monks also placed at our disposal
several skin boats. These were curious
craft. They resembled the Welsh coracle in
shape, being quite square, but were a great
deal larger, and capable of holding several
people at a time. They consisted merely of
skins stretched over thin stays of wood, were
very light, and drew very little water. A
man rowed them from one end, sitting on the
gunwale, any old bit of rope being used in
place of rowlocks to attach the rough peel-shaped
oars to the sides of the boat. Sometimes
two boats were tied together to make
one, in which case one boatman would row
at one end of the now oblong craft, while
another, sitting opposite him and facing him
on the gunwale at the far end, would assist by
'backing water.' Progress was slow in any
case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>We had brought with us several 'Berthon'
boats, which, consisting as they did
only of canvas stretched on to a wooden
framework, and being divisible into two
halves, had been carried along on the backs
of coolies without much difficulty. We had
with us also a useful gang of Attock boatmen,
men who knew how to circumvent the eddies
and currents of the Indus in its upper
reaches, and who did not fail us on the
Tsangpo. With the two large ferry boats,
the skin boats, the Berthon boats, the Attock
boatmen, and the contingent of Tibetan
boatmen from the monastery, all ready to
hand, it was possible to begin the crossing
of the river without a moment's delay.
Meanwhile, in order to reduce the number
of mules that would otherwise be largely
monopolising the large ferry boats, it was
decided to swim some mules across&mdash;a work
which was taken in hand at once. At the same
time the sappers, who in the field-park had
brought up various appliances for facilitating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
ferry work, made haste to set hawsers,
'travellers,' and wires in position for immediate
use. As soon as these contrivances
were in working order, which was not long,
the crossing proceeded at a pace which
exceeded our expectations.</p>

<p>But, before the crossing had well begun,
the saddest event of the Tibet Expedition
had occurred. We had lost a good many men
in action on various occasions, and a
few officers. In the preceding winter there
had been deaths more or less frequent from
such ills as flesh is heir to. But to fall in
action is a special contingency which all
soldiers have to face, and to die by disease
is the usual lot of mankind. At the loss of
comrades in these ways we grieve, but do not
grieve with any amazement. Far different
from this normal grief was our feeling when
we heard that some sepoys, and with them
Major Bretherton, our chief Supply and
Transport officer, had, while crossing the river,
been caught by one of several eddies formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
by the sharp jutting out of a certain rocky
headland into midstream, been capsized,
sucked down by the eddies, and drowned.</p>

<p>The gloom that was cast was, as I have
said, greater than that cast by the loss of
comrades in action. The ill luck in the case
of Major Bretherton seemed cruel. A moment
before we had seen him full of health,
cheery and active, confident of seeing in a few
days a happy termination to the anxieties
which in this march to Lhassa, with necessarily
slender commissariat, had been largely borne
by himself. We had known him not only as
decorated for past services, but as having,
during these past few months, by his able and
perpetual and unsparing work, ever daily enhanced
a reputation that was already assured.
Thus here was one, full of life and ripe for
honour, cut off in his prime. Upon the
Kamba-L√†, a day ago, we had thought with
a laugh of him as Moses viewing the
promised land, and now, as a lump came
into the throat, the same thought recurred,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
but this time full of sadness, for Lhassa, the
promised land, to help us to reach which he
had striven for nearly a year, was the land
which he himself was not to see.</p>

<p>His body was carried down the Tsangpo,
and we grieved at this, for we could not pay
it the honour we desired. But why should
we have grieved? For there, a pioneer always,
who had ever gloried in exploring the
confines of the Indian Empire, he had but
followed his bent, pursuing the mysterious
course of that river whose outlet still baffles
us.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A melancholy sequel to the death of an
officer on field service, whether occurring in
this or in any other way, is the inevitable
auction of his effects, for the conveyance of
few of which to the base is transport likely
to be available. A committee of adjustment
assembles, and, after reserving only such articles
as will be obviously acceptable to his
relations as mementoes and can easily be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
carried, puts up the remainder to auction.
To be auctioneer of the effects of a comrade
is not an enviable post. I had to auction
Major Bretherton's things, and found that
the adoption of the correct, breezy, businesslike
auctioneer's manner was up-hill work.
A man so stamps his individuality on his
belongings that often some well-worn familiar
garment, as for instance the 'coat-warm
British' with fur-lined collar that the officer
had been used to wear on cold mornings,
brings, as you hold it up to sale, many sad
associations. And yet you must look round
inquiringly, you must snatch on to the first
bid, and appeal loudly for a higher. When
the topmost bid is reached and no other is
forthcoming, you must throw the coat to the
buyer with a careless air and collect his
rupees.</p>

<p>The prices that different articles fetch at
these auctions is often amazing. The demand
of course depends on whether the force
as a whole has grown short of the particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
article now for sale, and whether it can or
cannot be obtained by the individual through
the post. Beyond Gyantse there was no
regular parcels post, so that of many articles
we were feeling a keen want. Accordingly, a
few sheets of note paper and a few envelopes
held up in the hand as one enticing 'lot'
would on that occasion fetch two rupees.
At another similar auction I remember half-pounds
of tobacco going for five rupees each,
and one-rupee packets of 'Three Castles'
cigarettes also for five rupees.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>THE END OF THE CROSSING: THE
'CHIT' IN TIBET</small></h2>

<p>The Sappers and Miners, the coolis, the
boatmen, the various units employed on
fatigue, and the mule drivers must have been
heartily glad when the crossing was all over.
We were leaving both yaks and donkeys
behind here (to work with convoys between
Gyantse and Chaksam), so that we did not
have to accomplish the feat of embarking
and disembarking these somewhat clumsy
animals; but even so, the amount of labour
that had been involved was immense. I am
told that, at any rate in Indian frontier warfare,
there has hitherto been no instance of a
force of this size crossing a river of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
dimension without the aid of a pontoon bridge
(the materials for which it would have been
impossible on this occasion to carry with us).
Further, the actual breadth of the river gave
no idea of the difficulty of crossing it. The
swiftness of the current, the whirlpools, and
the speed with which the river, fed as it was
by mountain streams, rose and fell, constituted
the main difficulties. Further, in addition
to the main channel which was the
chief obstacle, there was a second channel
beyond it, which, though not wide and sometimes
fordable, constituted an additional delay
to the crossing. As the last boatload
crossed, the river was rising fast, and I am
told that the amount of spare material left at
the ends of the long rope, which was the
main factor in swinging the large boats across
without letting them drift down-stream, could
be measured by the inch. Another inch or so
in the rise of the river, and a corresponding
widening of the stream, would have left that
rope all too short for the work it had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
accomplish, and our crossing might have been
indefinitely delayed, for afterwards the river
still continued rising.</p>

<p>We left the Tsangpo fairly well stocked
with provisions. During the march of forty-five
miles to Lhassa we were informed that
we should come across all that we required.
The road from North Chaksam followed the
course of the river for three miles; then,
taking a sharp turn to the left, entered
another wide valley watered by another
river, the course of which we were to trace
up-stream as far as Lhassa.</p>

<p>On the first day out of Chaksam I had
rather an amusing experience of the value
set by a Tibetan on a 'chit' written by a
British officer. In this respect the Tibetan
out-herods Herod. India is the land of
the 'chit.' The word is an abbreviation of
'chitthi,' a letter, and in its shortened form
is specially applied to a certificate of good
character given to a servant or to any pass
in guarantee of respectability on any simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
recognition of services rendered. A native
barber in India who has cut your hair three
times will ask for a 'chit' as a guarantee
that he has done so. But the Tibetan,
whether sophisticated lama or simple peasant,
was even more susceptible to the charms
of a 'chit,' those charms of course possessing
for him something of the mystical, since he
never understood its contents. Any 'chit'
was apparently regarded as a sort of talisman,
and was displayed by the owner with
pride and confidence to every one, especially
the next British officer who came his way.</p>

<p>On that day I was sent ahead with the
advance guard to see what supplies each
village contained. I had no transport with
me nor means of collecting the supplies, and
through an oversight had taken no one with
me to send back with messages to the rear
as to the result of my discoveries in each
village. There was no use in telling a villager
to point out to the officer who would
come after me what stores I had unearthed;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
for the villagers, though well paid, would
always evade supplying stores if possible.
The only expedient left was to make use of
those charms which were possessed by the
'chit.' In the first village I found fifty
maunds of tsampa; so, solemnly taking out
my pocket book, I wrote on a leaf of it
'fifty maunds of tsampa in a top-room of
the house with the big red door,' and, tearing
this out of the book, presented it with grave
dignity to the owner of the house. At the
next villages I acted similarly. Some hours
after I reached camp the officer in charge of
the transport that had been detailed for
foraging reached camp in due possession of
my fifty maunds of tsampa and all the other
articles that I had enumerated in the subsequent
chits. It had turned out exactly
as I had hoped. That officer had entered
the various villages in turn, and the proud
possessors of the chits, innocent of their real
purport, had come up to him and presented
them with childlike simplicity for him to read,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
and of course they had given him just the
information which they did not want to give
him, but which he required, and which I had
had no other means of conveying to him.</p>

<p>It was playing it rather low down perhaps,
but, after all, we wanted the supplies.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>MONASTERIES: FORAGING IN MONASTERIES:
A DREAM</small></h2>

<p>There were at least two fair-sized monasteries
which during the next few days we visited to
obtain supplies. Monasteries seem to vary
in character as they vary in size. Buddhism
seems, in fact, to have left its mark upon
Tibet in the manner of some great flood.
Here on a lone hilltop stands a tiny monastery
stagnant, like some small pool left by the
flood, the monks few in number, their persons
sordid, their minds vacant, and what remains
of their religion stale or even polluted; while
elsewhere in larger monasteries religion is
clearer and more vital, and life less stagnant.
This is a pure generalisation, and doubtless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
men, holy after their lights, often live in
remote hovels, and in the chiefer centres
religion may often be dreamy or callous, and
sordid vices be not unknown. But perhaps,
merely as a generalisation, the above may
hold good.</p>

<p>A foraging visit to a monastery was often
marked by several phases, in which the
relations between visitor and visited underwent
considerable change. The officer in
charge of the foraging party would ride up
to the monastery with his escort. They
would have been seen coming, and after a
few signs of hurrying and preparation and the
fluttering of several red monastic skirts in the
breeze, a small select deputation of monks
would descend from the main building to
meet the intruders. This deputation would
first and foremost bring with it a white
muslin rag as an emblem of peace. Along
with the rag would be carried peace-offerings,
of which the most common would be a tray
of whole-wheat parched and salted, or a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
basket of eggs, which, on nearer acquaintance
later in the day, would usually be found to be
neither new-laid nor fresh, but simply 'eggs.'</p>

<p>With the aid of an interpreter a pleasant
conversation would ensue. The officer
would then probably produce his hand-camera
and snapshot the head lama, after
which he would try to get to business. He
would ask how much of such and such
article the monastery could sell us. The
monks would shake their heads, flutter their
skirts, jerk up their thumbs, and in a shrill
falsetto repeat the word 'Menduk' (which
means 'nothing'). After a little more
parley they would confess to having, say,
twenty bagfuls of tsampa or whatever was
required. Even the naming of a high rate
and the jingling of a bag of rupees in their
faces would not make them raise the above
figure. You would then, if you were the
officer, proceed within the monastery and
demand to be shown the said twenty bagfuls.
You would be led with great pomp and circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
upstairs and along dark passages
and past rows of cells till you were ushered
into a small pantry or storeroom, where, with
a gesture of pompous satisfaction at having
so completely fulfilled your requirements, the
head monk would point to a few handfuls
of tsampa lying at the bottom of a small
elongated wooden trough. You would feel
a little annoyance at this, and show signs of
it. The head monk, as by a happy inspiration,
would suddenly beckon you to accompany
him, and, after another long meandering
through the monastery, would lead you to a
large doorway into a large darkened hall,
which, when your eyes became accustomed
to the dim light, you would recognise as the
main 'gompa' or temple of the monastery.
Here his hand would steal into yours, which
he would caress, while with his free hand he
pointed to the chief image of Buddha, which
he was apparently wishing you to admire.
Of course you admired him, but you wanted
tsampa, and this was obviously merely a ruse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
to detain you from your quest. British
choler would then rise, and, going out of the
temple with somewhat irreverent haste, you
would begin to express yourself forcibly in
terms which you made the interpreter translate.
The interpreter had probably an axe
of his own to grind, and it was doubtful how
many of your trenchant phrases, even if fit to
repeat in a monastery, got actually translated.
But after a great show of meaning business,
and a few threats of stronger measures in
the background, you probably got, say, fifty
maunds of tsampa from a proper storeroom
which the lamas had previously refrained
from showing you. A little later a few more
threats and the threatening crack of a whip
round the head of a 'chela' or two would
send the monks all skipping about in trepidation,
and the door of the main storeroom
would be opened to you, in which you would
find, it might be, two hundred maunds (or
three days' supply for the force) of the desired
article. After this you were all friends. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
ill-will was borne on either side. The junior
monks or 'chelas' would assist in bagging the
flour, and in carrying it down to the place
where the mules were waiting for it. The
money would be doled out and counted with
the greatest good humour, there would be
another proffer of parched wheat and rotten
eggs, and you would depart with the head
lama's blessing.</p>

<p>After one such visit I dreamed a dream.
I knocked in a boisterous swash-buckling
manner at Tom Gate, the main gate of my
old college&mdash;Christ Church. Behind me,
stretching up St. Aldate's to Carfax, were a
string of pack mules, fitted with empty bags,
forage nets, and loading ropes. The gate
was opened by those of the porters whom I
knew years ago. One, an old soldier, saluted
me. Then it occurred to me that I was a
Japanese officer, and that in the year 2004
the Japanese army were invading England.
I was at the head of a foraging party, and we
had come to loot the House. We had a fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
time. We started of course by ringing up
the Dean. He too blessed me, and when I
asked him for some of that old Burgundy
that I know was a speciality of the senior
common-room cellar, he showed me round
the cathedral and pointed out the restored
shrine of St. Frideswide. This was not what
I wanted, and I told him so. I brought the
mules in from outside, and set them to graze
on the neat plots of turf that encircle 'Mercury'
the fountain, and told him they must
all go away laden with the good things
of the Christ Church larder and cellar, at
which he protested. Some undergraduates
emerged in cap and gown from a lecture
room and began to show fight. We drove
them into Peckwater at the point of the
bayonet.</p>

<p>Then the Steward and the Junior Censor
appeared, and the latter began to reason with
us in what I considered a tone unbecoming
to a private person resident in an invaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
country. I raised a heavy knout which I
carried, and was going to flog the Junior
Censor where he stood, when the Steward
intervened, and, giving hurried orders to all
the scouts and porters that stood around
watching the scene, soon produced the finest
store of provisions that we had met with
in all our campaigning. The mules were
marched out of Tom Gate, up St. Aldate's,
along the Corn and out to Port Meadow,
where we were encamped, laden with sirloins
of beef, with turkeys, with geese and ducks
and fowls and pheasants, with beer in the
barrel and port wine in the case, while I
remember taking special personal possession
of a mould of 'aspic of larks' which I fancied
for my supper.</p>

<p>But then I woke, and by doing so felt
done out of that aspic of larks, which would
have been a pleasant change from the fare of
those days.</p>

<p>Quite a silly dream of course; but on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
recalling it with my waking thoughts, and
feeling sympathy for the Dean and students
of Christ Church, I felt some too for those
poor lamas whom we had invaded the day

<small>REACHING LHASSA: SUPPLIES: MESSING: THE
LHASSA BAZAAR</small></h2>

<p>The mode of our arrival in the environs of
Lhassa was something of an anti-climax.
We had marched four hundred miles, fought
a few fights, and provided ourselves throughout
our journey with the necessaries of life,
much against the will of the enemy, and
here we were at Lhassa, where an exciting
climax to our march, such as a good fight in
the Lhassa plain, would have been highly
artistic. Here stood the Debun monastery,
and there further on the Sara monastery,
full of monks who at that time hated us. A
few good shells in those monasteries would
have set the monks buzzing in consternation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
like swarming bees disturbed. There glistened
in the sun the gilded roof of the
chief astrologer's house, that would have
made grand loot and have looked so well in
the British Museum. There ahead of us
rose majestically on its conical hill the Pot√°-L√†,
that <i>pi√®ce de r√©sistance</i> which would have
really taxed our efforts, and by its side on a
similar hill the Medical College, challenging
us by its proud eminence to seize it. But
such wild schemes were not to be realised.
These ways were not our ways. We marched
quietly into a swampy camp, sat down, and
began to negotiate. Those that negotiated
were busy men, for the amount of talking that
the representatives of the Tibetan Government
got through, and that needed listening
to, before anything was settled, must have
been immense. The rest of us were not
often very busy. 'Those also serve who only
stand and wait' was our motto.</p>

<p>There was reluctance at first on the part
of the monasteries to sell us supplies, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
this was shortly overcome. We had for one
day to feed the natives of the force on peas
soaked overnight in water as a substitute
for tsampa, while waiting for supplies to
come in; but from the time when the latter
began to do so till we left Lhassa we felt
no pinch. The large monasteries were our
chief purveyors, but besides these the Chinese
community of Lhassa comprised certain considerable
merchants who at the instigation of
the Amban placed their wares at our disposal
from the very first. A Chinese market was a
great boon to us, for the Chinaman, especially
if at all influenced by other civilisations, has
ideas on dietetics more nearly approximating
to both those of the British and of the native
of India than do the Tibetan's ideas. To the
ordinary Tibetan the sucking of mouthfuls of
tsampa at irregular intervals from a dirty
leather bag which he hangs from his neck
represents an adequate idea of diet. The
monks and richer laymen of course do themselves
better; but such dainties as they indulge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
in did not appeal to our palates, nor to those
of Indian natives. Their butter, for instance,
which at times both British and native
had to make use of, had always a special
flavour of its own&mdash;a flavour which in an
indefinable way suggests Tibet and its many
associations, being allied to a blend of such
smells as that of Tibetan fuel, of joss-stick
incense, and of temple floors smeared with
grease. Few Europeans and fewer natives
could eat Tibetan butter with relish. The
Chinaman, on the other hand, provided us
with flour sufficiently fine to bake with, with
white and brown sugar, with that solidified
form of molasses called 'goor,' and with
dried fruits. Latterly we had often had to mix
tsampa with flour to eke out our stock of the
latter when baking bread for British <ins class="corr" title="missing period inserted">troops.</ins>
The result, though not unwholesome, was of
a deep brown colour, and hardly palatable.
If once cut into overnight, a tsampa
loaf would have subsided into something
very stodgy by morning, though, if all consumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
at a sitting, it would not be found so
heavy.</p>

<p>During the latter part of our march we
had run out of most of such delicacies as a
supply column usually carries, and, as I have
already mentioned, no arrangement could be
made to bring up the loads and loads of parcels
which were now accumulating at Gyantse
for most individuals and messes belonging to
the column. In those days, in our attitude
towards food, we reverted very much to the
proverbial school-boy. We were frankly
greedy in thought, word, and deed. The
most favourite of interesting conversations
was to discuss the ideal menu at a first-rate
London restaurant. But sometimes these
imaginings grew too painful. I remember
well a case of two officers at noon on a
comparatively hot day, sitting by the wayside
at a halt.</p>

<p>'Ah,' said one, 'what I should really like
now would be a large tumblerful of good iced
hock-cup.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>These idle words touched a tender spot
in the other officer, to whom hock-cup happened
to be the beau-ideal of drinks.</p>

<p>'Shut up!' the latter answered angrily, a
fierce light in his eye; 'if you mention hock-cup
again, I'll break your head!'</p>

<p>Jam, as we marched to Lhassa, though
not a necessity, was our primary desideratum.
With long days in the open air and also with
considerable fatigue to undergo, you craved
for the sustenance of sweet things. Till
sugar also began to run short, we used to
make treacle from it. Like the school-boy,
we, as a rule, thought little of alcohol. Just
as water at that altitude boils at a low
temperature, so did it need only a little fiery
spirit to give the desired tingle to the blood.
Most messes had soon run out of whiskey,
and rum in small quantities from the supply
column took its place.</p>

<p>I am inclined to think that, delightful as
messing in a large mess is, something is lost
by having no personal share in your own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
catering. A mess president, of course,
especially on service, has a vast weight
upon his shoulders. He has to foresee
the wants of many hungry mouths months
ahead, and fit them in to a scanty allowance
of transport. But his function is of a
special kind. The ordinary member of a
mess simply eats what is put before him,
notes whether it is good, bad, or indifferent,
and thinks no more about it. On the other
hand, if, with the aid of a purely experimental
cook, you run your own messing, quite a new
vista of energy is at once opened out to
you. It becomes intensely interesting. You
become very greedy, of course, and a good
dinner becomes the mark of a successful day,
and a bad dinner that of an unsuccessful one;
but even so the arts of catering and of the
supervision of cooking, when practised in
difficulties, are not in themselves sordid, but
demand skill and forethought of a high order.
One wants company of course. I messed
on the method of Mr. and Mrs. Jack Spratt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
with another officer. He was of the lean, I
the fat kind. He breakfasted at eleven, or
(if on the march) when he reached camp.
I ate a huge breakfast the moment I was out
of bed, and ran to a lunch later, which my
messmate scorned. So, after all, we only
met at dinner, but then that is the only
meal at which company is a necessity. He
dined usually on curry and rice, which I have
always disliked, while I had roast meat
served up to me in chunks on a dish, much
as my dog gets it at home. Thus we got
all the mutual advantages of each other's
company when that was desirable, without
the effort of subscribing to each other's
tastes. We found it a most workmanlike
arrangement. When, on reaching Lhassa,
we had ample leisure, we began to grow
fastidious, and to insist upon our cooks
enlarging the culinary horizon. A little
harsh treatment soon taught the youth who
fed me to turn out a passable omelette, and
a little more coercion resulted in quite eatable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
rissoles. In the end, when he came to take
orders for dinner, he would rattle off a string
of high-sounding dishes with French names,
which would have really made a fine feast,
if served otherwise than on enamelled iron
plates, set upon a table cloth of advertisement
sheets from a stale newspaper. Once I had a
comrade to lunch on a sunny day, and, thinking
to do him well, produced somewhere from
the bottom of my kit a long disused but
spotless bed sheet, and made use of this
as a table cloth. My friend asked for its
removal before the second course, complaining
of incipient snow-blindness. When I got
to India and to polite society, and began
wiping my mouth with a table napkin, I
discovered that on the first few occasions
the napkin used to come away in my pocket.
Of course, on making use of it, one thought
subconsciously that it was one's handkerchief,
and so tucked it away as such.</p>

<p>Tobacco, without a parcels post to bring
it to us, became very scarce. The Sahib<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
missed his pipe or cheroot, and the native his
'hubble-bubble,' and both alike took to the
'Pedro' cigarette, the produce of an enterprising
firm whose custom extended to Lhassa.
Vendors of Pedros had followed us on the
march, and, apart from this, the Lhassa
bazaar abounded in the article, getting it,
I suppose, through China or by the trade
route that lies through Nepal. By a rough
estimate it would appear that for two months
at least four thousand souls smoked an
average of ten Pedros daily. The rate grew
very much enhanced with the constant demand,
and I know of one needy officer who,
in view of the fortune thus doubtless made
by the firm, has announced his intention of
going head-down for home and offering his
hand and heart to Miss Pedro, if he finds
such a person existing.</p>

<p>Shopping in the camp bazaar was the
ladylike way in which we often spent our
mornings. We had only been in camp at
Lhassa for twenty-four hours, when a bazaar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
was formed just outside camp by Tibetan,
Chinese, and Nepali traders. It needed a
little supervision to prevent disputes and disorder,
but the provost-marshal quickly had
it in hand. An attempt to fix rates for
various more necessary articles was not
wholly successful, human nature on the
buyer's part crying out for the article at all
cost, and human nature on the seller's seizing
an easy chance of profit. There were vegetables
in that bazaar and sticks of wild
rhubarb. There was 'ata,' in small quantities,
which the sepoy would buy greedily as a
change from his tsampa. There were packets
of white loaf sugar fetching exorbitant prices,
and thick Chinese candles with bits of stick
for wicks. Later on, when we had moved
from our first camp to that which we occupied
for the greater part of the time, the bazaar
developed. The vendors by that time had
discovered our childish mania for curios, and
brought with them each morning such trinkets
as would attract our fancy. Skins of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
kinds would be brought for sale; the skins of
very young lambs, almost as curly as real
Astrakan, which, made up together in winter
linings for lamas' robes, seemed equally
adaptable to the opera cloaks of our sisters
and cousins and aunts at home; skins too of
the lynx, the marmot, the wolf, and the snow
fox. And women would come wearing heavy
earrings set with turquoises and 'charm boxes'
similarly set, which they wore as lockets at
the neck. They would take these off to sell
to you and haggle, like the veritable Eastern
traders that they were, with you for the price.</p>

<p>Besides the Tibetan or Chinese candle,
we also found imported candles of European
manufacture. But most imports for household
use appeared to be Japanese, as, for
instance, soap and matches; neither of these
were of good quality, and Japan does not
seem to take pains to appear at her best in
the Lhassa market. But to get a new cake
of soap, even if it did crumble away quickly,
was a luxury, and the return to a land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
matches was a great relief. I remember an
officer who on the march had latterly possessed
himself of a Tibetan flint and steel
and learnt to light a cigarette with them.</p>

<p>There are just about half a dozen prime
necessities of no great bulk which always
seem to run out sooner than expected on
field service. A reserve in a supply column
of the following would always come in useful:
of matches, three mule loads; of wax candles,
seven mule loads; of soap, ten mule loads;
of some strong forbidding kind of tobacco
that in times of privation would go a very
long way, ten mule loads; of chocolate creams
and barley sugar, thirty mule loads. Sixty
such mules laid out per brigade would be
much blessed.</p>

<p>When relations with the Tibetans had
become less strained, we used to go in organised
parties to visit the bazaar in Lhassa
city itself. These parties reminded one of a
Sunday-school treat. The part of curate
would be played by some field-officer who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
would collect his school children outside
camp. These would consist of those officers,
soldiers, sepoys, and followers whose turn it
was to go. He would conduct us with careful
supervision from the camp to the city, and
there let us loose for two hours to play in the
bazaar. The bazaar was one circular street,
surrounding the cathedral which, though once
or twice entered by favoured individuals, was
out of bounds for us.</p>

<p>In the city the same kinds of things were
for sale as were brought to the camp bazaar,
but there was a larger variety of imported
goods. How some of those things ever got
to Lhassa was a mystery. In one shop I
saw a whole row of small looking-glasses
'made in Austria,' and beside them a score
or so of penknives 'made in Germany.' The
British tradesman's pictorial almanac will, I
suppose, be found hanging on the gates of
the new Jerusalem; it had certainly penetrated
Lhassa, usually in the form of a royal
family group. One coronation group on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
wall of a Kashmiri shop was especially fine.
Strangest of all to find was a bicycle of the
Rover pattern&mdash;quite out of gear, but doubtless
interesting to the Tibetan as a Western
curio. He may have thought it was a
species of Christian prayer-wheel.</p>

<p>I was short of dinner plates, and bought
one. It was of tin, and had stamped on it a
comprehensive lesson in both political and
physical geography. All round the rim faces
of clocks were stamped. Each face was encircled
with a scroll containing the name and
the number of the population of some large
city of the world, while the clock in the
centre showed what the time was in that city
when the clock in London stood at twelve
noon. The population of London as stamped
on the plate stood at quite a low figure, but
London was selected as the honoured city
whose clock should stand at the precise hour
of noon, and the whole geography lesson was
in English. One would therefore come to
the conclusion that the plate was a British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
product, dating back to the period of some
not very recent census. To have traced
that plate from Birmingham to Lhassa would
have been interesting.</p>

<p>Beggars swarmed in the bazaar. One
man earned an obviously ample livelihood
by carrying his grandfather on his back
through the streets. The grandfather was
certainly the quintessence of decrepitude, and
as such would appeal to the benevolent, who
apparently never thought of suggesting to the
young man that it would be better to leave
grandfather at home in bed, and go out unencumbered
to earn an honest living. Malefactors
in chains are also seen crawling about,
a peripatetic prison being apparently less felt
by the Lhassa exchequer than one of bricks
and mortar.</p>

<small>ENOUGH OF LHASSA: A TRIP DOWN COUNTRY:
LIFE IN A POST: TRUE HOSPITALITY:
A BHUTYA PONY</small></h2>

<p>Since I reached India, I have been told
that every moment I spent in the romantic
environs of Lhassa must have been intensely
interesting, and that to have been to Lhassa is
the envy of the world. I suppose, like the
brute one is, one got <i>blas√©</i> and indifferent to
one's good fortune, but it is certain that those
'crowded hours of glorious life' began to pall.
We did the best we could to while away the
time. An energetic race committee provided
gymkhanas and a 'sky meeting' (just, says
the intelligent foreigner, what a British army
<i>would</i> indulge in, on arrival at such a place).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
A football tournament followed. Football at
thirteen thousand feet is like playing the
game at an ordinary level&mdash;with an eighty-pound
load on your back. Less strain on
the lungs was a rifle meeting. To escort
our military or political betters to the city
on a state visit was another mild form of
entertainment. The Chinese Amban often
received such visits. The ordinary officer
who formed part of the escort did not take
part in the actual visit. He stayed outside
on the doorsteps. Sometimes he was known
to go into the Amban's kitchen, where an
elderly matron gave him a cup of tea.</p>

<p>Luckily, though it rained generally once
in the twenty-four hours, it did so mostly at
night, so that we were seldom confined to
our tents in the daytime. Even so, we felt
rather like prisoners. Going out beyond the
vicinity of the camp meant going out armed,
and proceeding to any distance meant being
accompanied by an escort, such precautions
having been specially indicated by the attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
made on two officers by a certain fanatical
lama.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that the life we led
left many gaps which it was hard to fill. I
was glad when one day I got orders to go
on a ten days' trip down the line as far as
Pete-jong and back.</p>

<p>These ten days initiated me into the life
of those portions of the force who had been
left to man posts on the line of communications.</p>

<p>The native soldier soon makes himself
very much at home in his post. He has
deeply regretted not going to the front, but
with a useful belief in 'kismet' makes the
best of things. The relief from marching
and the ample leisure to cook food are redeeming
features. The post-commandant,
if the only British officer on the spot, feels his
circumstances more acutely. Not only does
he grieve at being left behind, but since in
ordinary times no life is more social than that
of a British officer, he at first feels his loneliness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
greatly. He may love his men, he may be&mdash;in
the wording of that common Hindustani
metaphor&mdash;veritably their 'father and mother,'
but still he cannot go to them for company.
He can exchange few ideas with them, and
as regards social intercourse, he is almost as
much alone as if he were on a desert island.
If, however, by any chance there are two
officers together in one post, they should enjoy
themselves. For though ordinary regimental
life is, as I said above, the most social
in the world, it yet also suffers from the disabilities
of its own sociability. In a regimental
mess you know twenty men well, and
may go on knowing them so for twenty
years, but perhaps you will never know any
one of them really intimately. To share a
post on the line of communications with one
other officer for a few months should result
in an intimacy. That is almost a new
military experience.</p>

<p>If a post-commandant had shooting or
fishing within reach of his post, he usually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
even though alone, soon found life bearable.
Sometimes foraging to collect a reserve of
rations for the march down was his only
recreation, and this soon palled. He was not
necessarily always alone, for the traffic up and
down the line was sometimes brisk, and he
would perhaps once or twice in a week be
invaded by some officer who was travelling
up or down with the post or with a convoy.</p>

<p>It was my lot to be often such an invader,
and for sheer genuine hospitality commend
me to the officers in charge of the posts on
the Sikkim-Tibet line of communications.
It shames me to think of the way they have
entertained me, and of my utter inability
to return their hospitality. May I have a
chance some time!</p>

<p>I had to go down to Chaksam with
the mounted infantry postal escort which
travelled the whole distance in one day,
going as light as possible, my syce on one
mule, my bedding on a second, and a mule
driver on a third, and without either cook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
or orderly. It was a case of 'sponging'
wherever I went, for I knew those kind hosts
down the line would forbid me to live off
bully-beef and biscuits. Looking over my
belongings before I left, I found a tinned oxtongue,
which by an oversight had remained
unregarded and uneaten somewhere at the
bottom of a kit bag for many months. A
convoy too had just come in, and from it I
seized one of a few pots of jam. Thus armed
I visited Chaksam and Pete-jong. These two
articles were all that I could proffer in return
for hospitality, but both under present conditions
were dainty rarities, and, my hosts
assured me, quite paid for my keep. At
Chaksam, where the tongue was left, and
where there was a doctor as well as a post-commandant,
I was afterwards informed that
the doctor, as soon as I was gone, promptly
found the post-commandant suffering from
acute enteritis, so put him on to milk diet
and wolfed all the tongue himself!</p>

<p>The postal service from Gyantse to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
Lhassa was performed by mounted infantry,
each garrison <i>en route</i> containing a detachment
of mounted infantrymen, who took
the post from stage to stage. The stages
were pretty far apart. The first was from
Gyantse to Ralung, over thirty miles; the
second over the Karo-L√† to Nagartse, a
distance of nearly thirty; the third from
Nagartse to Pete-jong, eighteen miles; the
fourth from Pete-jong to Chaksam, thirty-two;
and the fifth and last from Chaksam
to Lhassa, about forty-five. The work
thus done by the mounted infantry between
Lhassa and Gyantse was considerable. A
fairly hefty sepoy, carrying rifle and accoutrements
and a few mail bags, is no mean
weight to put on the back of a thirteen-hand
pony, even for a short distance, and it
is surprising how well the ponies, some of
them ordinary country-breds from the plains
of India, stood those long marches. Keeping
them shod was a considerable difficulty,
for the combination of damp weather and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
stony roads knocked the shoes off very
quickly, and the stock of the latter was
limited.</p>

<p>Having done my work at Chaksam and
Pete-jong, I returned to the former place with
the post, prepared to proceed to Lhassa the
next day; but it had been raining in torrents
for some days past, and, though mail bags
and the like could be taken across the river
in skin boats, there was no chance of taking
my pony and mules across till the flood
subsided. After three days it was found
possible to take the animals over at Parte (the
crossing which the column subsequently used
on the march down), ten miles up the river,
and the following day I was able to reach
Lhassa with the upward post.</p>

<p>I shall not easily forget that day. It
has been made memorable to me by the
vagaries of a certain Bhutya pony ridden by
an officer who was accompanying me. To
get one's kit and oneself over forty-five
miles of indifferent roadway in one day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
especially when you have no change of
mount, involves early rising. We got up at
four o'clock, after sleeping in the domestic
temple of a Tibetan farm-house on a sacred
but not very clean floor. We sent our kit
on ahead, and also my syce, who was mounted
on a mule, in charge of part of the mounted
infantry postmen. The remainder of the
latter accompanied our two selves a little
later. My companion had not ridden his
pony for some time, and the latter, disliking
the process of being mounted, began by
suddenly sidling away when his master was
only half on his back, with the result that his
master came off and tumbled to the ground,
still keeping hold of the reins. The pony,
anxious to be free, danced a jig on his
master's stomach. Luckily, being of a hard-footed
hill-breed, his feet were not shod, so
that no serious injury resulted, as would have
been the case if the trampling had been done
in iron shoes. At length the pony broke
away from the reins and scampered off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
leaving his rider to recover the breath that
had been squeezed out of his body and to
pick himself up. This was an awkward
beginning to the day's march, but, finding no
bones broken, and the pony having, for the
occasion, allowed himself to be caught, my
friend mounted, successfully this time, and
we proceeded on our way. After some miles
we overtook and passed the other party, and
pushed on till, finding we had gone twenty
miles from Chaksam, were in a pleasant spot
suitable for resting in, and were uncommonly
hungry, we dismounted, took our ponies'
bridles off, tied the animals up, gave them
their grain, and set to work upon our own
sandwiches.</p>

<p>We rested an hour, and, thinking our
surroundings too pleasant to leave abruptly,
we decided on another half-hour's
rest. Just as we had done so, and were
looking forward to a spell of peaceful contemplation
of romantic scenery, as seen
through the beautifying haze of tobacco-smoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
one of us noticed that the Bhutya
was fidgeting with his head rope. He was
on the edge of a field of green peas that were
tickling his fancy. As we looked, by some
device known only, I should think, to Bhutya
ponies, he slipped the neck rope over one
ear. Before we could get at him he had
slipped it over the other and was free. The
only man who had ever been known to catch
the pony when he was free was his own syce,
whom his master had left at Chaksam.
Here we were twenty miles from Chaksam
and twenty-five from Lhassa, and my friend
with many bruises on his body already contracted
that morning, and a sore hip that,
though not preventing him riding, yet hurt
him every time that he tried to walk.</p>

<p>The party that we had overtaken now
came up, and, after sending on most of the
escort so as not to detain His Majesty's
mails, we proceeded to try all the dodges
known to us of catching a refractory pony.
I suppose, if we had been cowboys trained to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
use the lasso, we should have had no trouble.
As it was, we experienced much.</p>

<p>A feeding-bag full of grain held out coaxingly
at arm's length made the pony laugh.
I tried him with a bit of commissariat biscuit,
at which&mdash;as is often the way of people&mdash;he
snorted. I tried stalking him from behind
my own pony, and got fairly near him, only
to find his two heels perilously near our two
heads. We laid a grand snare, in the shape
of two mule loading ropes joined together,
and stretched across a tempting patch of
the green-pea field, where not a trace of the
rope could be seen, while the men at each
end of the rope lounged peacefully and
innocently with reassuring looks upon their
faces which we thought would not prevent
the pony being quietly urged into the
space between them. This ruse nearly succeeded.
The pony stalked along, grazing as
he went, till his feet were against the rope, at
which the men holding it, after raising it a
little, tried to run to the rear and so encircle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
the pony. But before they had gone far he
was kicking and tugging with his chest
against the rope, and in a moment had
wrenched it out of the hands of one of the
men, and the next minute, after a series of
derisive buckjumps, was in the next field
munching young wheat.</p>

<p>After fifty minutes of fruitless man&oelig;uvring
we decided on a new plan. Half a mile
further on, the road left the open space where
we now were, and, running close to the side
of the river, was flanked on the other side by
almost precipitous rocks. The road here,
therefore, formed a perfect defile, and we
decided to proceed on our way, ignoring the
Bhutya and trusting to his gregarious instinct
and a little wholesome neglect on our part to
induce him to follow us of his own initiative.
We moved off in a body&mdash;mules, ponies, and
men. The Bhutya, tired of green peas and
young wheat, looked after us and followed
us at a gentle trot. We left my syce in
ambush just outside the defile, but this proved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
unnecessary; for the pony, now quite anxious
about being left behind, pushed his way in
ahead of the last mounted infantryman, so
that at last we had him in a trap. But to
catch hold of him, now that he was in the
trap, still taxed our efforts. A mounted
infantryman grabbed him once by the forelock,
and nearly got wrenched off his own
pony by doing so, while the Bhutya leapt
away, leaving in the man's hand enough of
his own forelock to stuff a good pincushion.
My syce had now come up. He was an
elderly man, more intelligent in these matters
than any of those present. He tempted the
pony with bits of a tsampa chapatti that he
drew from his pocket. The pony, forgetful
of wheat and green peas, took to these.
The syce in an instant had the reins of the
bridle round the pony's neck, and would
have held him fast had not he been lifted off
his feet by the latter's rearing up. The pony
was now free again and very indignant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
Rampaging about, he tried to find an exit
through a batch of mules in one direction and
a batch of mounted infantry in the other, but
found himself baffled in both. He looked
up the rocks and found them impossible to
climb, looked at the river beneath him and
seemed to contemplate taking a header, but
thought better of it, and at last stood
sullenly at bay. My syce's next proffer of
his own wayside ration brought the pony to
terms. A rope-twitch was round his lip in
an instant, and a moment later he stood
bridled and in his right mind.</p>

<p>So on we hastened to Lhassa at last, glad
to have secured the pony, but now somewhat
belated. At Trelung bridge, eight miles out
of Lhassa, was a small garrison, guarding the
bridge. The officer in command fed us with
a sumptuous tea. Much refreshed, we sped on
our way, getting within sight of camp just as
it was turning pitch dark, and having cause
to realise the efficacy of our own camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
defences by the way we floundered among
ditches and abattis when barely twenty yards
from the camp perimeter.</p>

<p>There was a 'Tommies' gaff' that night,
outside the camp, around a roughly erected
stage lit up with Chinese candles and decked
out with green brushwood that had previously
been used to make the jumps at the last gymkhana.
We assembled to hear the familiar
types of songs that form the programme of a
soldiers' sing-song&mdash;some witty, some rather
vulgar, some modified with topical variations
by local poets, and all full of good cheer.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE SIGNING OF THE TREATY</small></h2>

<p>A day or two after&mdash;that is to say, on the
seventh day of September 1904&mdash;the treaty
was signed. If our peaceful arrival at Lhassa
had been the anti-climax of the Expedition,
this&mdash;the signing of the treaty&mdash;though peaceful
also, was its true climax. One certainly
did have a feeling that day that one was
witness of an event of imperial importance.</p>

<p>The escort left camp at 1.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Over
the assembling of the troops outside camp
one of those typical&mdash;and to the onlooker
highly entertaining&mdash;muddles arose, which
are always either the fault of some one or
no one or every one. Eventually we found
ourselves, all except a body of mounted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
infantry who were still unaccountably missing.
Their place was, however, adequately filled
by a party of Kot-duffadars of mule corps,
who, mounted on transport riding ponies,
and armed with swords and staves or whatever
obsolete weapon is nowadays issued to
them, took a prominent place in the procession
and made a brave show. We marched
past that pleasant country seat known as
'Paradise,' where the political mission had
their quarters, and proceeded along a path
lined with troops, across a bog into the outskirts
of the city, and up the road which leads
up the Pot√°-L√† hill into the Pot√°-L√†. We
had eventually to dismount, leave our ponies,
and climb up a paved pathway, half staircase.
This pathway was smeared with the holy
grease of ages and was dangerously slippery.
At the top we found some of the guard of the
Nepalese resident, looking very warlike in
red secondhand tunics that had once been
the property of British soldiers, but were of a
now obsolete pattern. Ushered through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
dark passage, we entered at last into the
throne-room or audience-hall of the Pot√°-L√†,
where the ceremony was to take place.
When all that portion of the escort who were
allowed within the hall had taken their places
Colonel Younghusband and General Macdonald
with their respective Staffs arrived.
The room already held the various contingents
of Eastern officials of different nationalities
who were to assist at the function.
After we had all stood up, there was a great
deal of handshaking between the representatives
of East and West. The Chinese
Amban shakes hands in a manner that, when
last I frequented London drawing-rooms, was,
I believe, considered fashionable. One of
the lay council of Tibet certainly thought
so, for he tried to imitate the particular
method, but only partially succeeded. The
party then sat down to tea. A great deal
of tea was drunk&mdash;that milkless tea in handleless
china cups with which we had most of
us now become acquainted. All sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
Chinese sweetmeats were provided with it,
and these were followed by cigarettes (our
old friend the 'Pedro'). These dainties did
not extend into the outer circles; those of
us who were behind contented ourselves by
lighting up our own Pedros.</p>

<p>A glance round the room showed many
bright colours and striking contrasts. There,
near to the throne, were our political officers
in the rich but not gaudy uniform of their
service; next them the G.O.C. and his
Staff in the sober khaki, while all round the
room in less prominent places was more
khaki. But next to Colonel Younghusband
in robes of bright blue silk sat the Amban.
Next to the Amban was the Regent, who,
since the disappearance of the Dalai Lama,
had been the officiating head of the Tibetan
Government, an elderly man with a sad
ascetic face, and dressed quite simply in the
plain red robes of an ordinary lama. Next
to him was a row of Chinese officials, of
whose uniform, as in the case of the Amban,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
bright blue silk formed the chief part.
Further away were the seats of the Nepalese
contingent, at the head of whom sat the
Nepali resident, a fierce-looking old man
in a rather shabby and uncommonly short
jacket of plum-coloured brocade lined with
fur. Alongside, but at a different angle and
facing the throne, sat the Tonsil Penlop and
his suite. These represented Bhutan and
were all clad in striped yellow silk robes,
which one can only describe as barbaric.
Their millinery was also marvellous, the
Tonsil Penlop himself wearing a kind of
bonnet, on the top of which was perched a
whole stuffed bird, which in the distance appeared
to be a parrot. Immediately opposite
the throne were the Tibetan lay council of
three. They affected plain yellow silk and yellow
hats, but the yellow was of a bright shade,
and the general effect of their appearance was
as magnificent as that of any of the others.
In face they struck me as the least attractive
of the various Eastern officials present, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
unhealthy-looking, rather fat, and wearing
what seemed a sulky cowed expression. Behind
them stood a whole array of monks.</p>

<p>The process of signing began almost at
once. The number of documents seemed
never ending. Apparently there were several
copies of the treaty in every language spoken
by any of the parties directly or remotely
concerned with it, and every one of these
copies had to be signed, not only by the chief
authorities above enumerated, but also by
various lesser lights of Tibet, as, for instance,
the heads of certain monasteries. At one
period the limelight flashed upon us, and we
all had our photographs taken from a corner
of the room.</p>

<p>We saw many copies of the treaty being
signed with great care, but gathered nothing
of its contents except from the speech which,
when at last the signing was over, Colonel
Younghusband addressed to the Tibetans in
general, and to the 'council of three' in
particular. The latter sat bobbing their heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
deferentially at each sentence, and looking
thoroughly ashamed while Colonel Younghusband
addressed them from his chair.
The speech was translated sentence by
sentence into Tibetan for Tibetan benefit,
and afterwards passed on in Chinese to
the Amban.</p>

<p>The speech was emphatically a 'straight
talk,' the key-note seeming to be that the
Tibetans had been very foolish in opposing
and flouting us in the past, but that they were
now going to be good boys. They were going
to be well treated when they came to visit us,
and were not going to misbehave themselves
in any way, should we again come near them.
There was more said, about trade relations
with India, in recognition of the Chinese
suzerainty, and in encouragement of the
Tibetan traditional methods of treating outsiders,
when those outsiders did not happen
to be ourselves.</p>

<p>The council of three seemed to take it all
'lying down.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>More tea was drunk: the press correspondents
busied themselves with the telegrams
that they were sending down by post
to Gyantse, bringing the wires there and then
to the press censor, whose blue pencil I saw
freely wielded: more handshaking, and then
the party broke up.</p>

<p>As we left the now close atmosphere of
the audience hall, we felt that we had just
witnessed a matin√©e performance in a theatre.
The spectacular effects throughout had been
impressive. The first act had been brisk,
the second had dragged, but the last had
been thrilling. It had indeed been a fine
play that we had seen enacted&mdash;the simple
sane perseverance of British diplomacy
fighting on its own ground a unique section
of the mysterious and gorgeous East, not
bluffed by its indignant protests, not deceived
by its spurious promises, not wearied by its
endless delays, not impatient of its crass
ignorance, but gaining its objects slowly and
surely, and coming out victorious.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>BACK TO INDIA</small></h2>

<p>Thereafter, like the man in the sycamore
tree, we made haste to come down. Sixteen
days later the column left Lhassa. A few
functions intervened, such as the formal release
of our prisoners and the bestowal of money
in charity on the poor of Lhassa. I missed
these functions, having been sent on ahead
to the Tsangpo, where preparations for the
return crossing were now afoot. The column
at length arrived at the river. We crossed
this time at Parte, where a certain single
channel of moderate breadth, but very deep
and therefore not very swift, served our
purposes far better than the double channel
at Chaksam. The Sappers and Miners and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
coolis had made all things ready, towing
the two heavy ferry boats up many miles of
swift current, and rigging up the mysterious
engineering paraphernalia which were needed
to swing us across, our crossing hanging truly
and literally by a thread&mdash;a thread of thin
wire. Wire, at once the lightest and strongest
commodity of its kind, had since our last
crossing been sent up to us, in great quantities,
and was largely used to replace the now rotten
rope that had previously been chiefly employed.
A great ferry boat, bearing twenty
mules, to which was attached a string of skin
boats laden with stores, to which again were
attached a brace or so of mules swimming in
the water, would be swung across that still
swift current, suspended from but one or two
thin wires.</p>

<p>The speed of the crossing exceeded all
hopes. It was accomplished in about forty-eight
hours. From South Parte we marched,
over a pass that was new to us, straight into
Pete-jong. At the top of that pass facing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
southwards we found a wall, which had
obviously been built by the Tibetans in the
belief that on our march upwards we would
cross the ridge by this route. It was a well-conceived
fortification, and might have given
us considerable trouble.</p>

<p>From Parte Ferry to Gyantse we marched
in two columns. Thinking the crossing of
the ferry might occupy several days, and in
order to be prepared for all emergencies such
as any possible ebullitions of hostility that
might delay our march, we had laid in at the
ferry and the posts on the way to Gyantse a
stock of supplies which now proved larger than
our needs, while our spare transport was only
sufficient to carry on a portion of the surplus.</p>

<p>I accompanied the second column and
had the pleasant duty of making away with
this surplus. To one whose purse has
always been slender, and whose nature is
correspondingly extravagant, there can be
nothing more agreeable than to dispose in a
free-handed way of large amounts of Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
property. One enjoys all the delights
of extravagance with none of its bitter aftertaste.
Of course, even from the strictly
economical view, it was far the best policy
to make away with these surpluses where
they stood. The total value of the stores
so made away with, though amounting to a
large sum, was far less than, for instance,
would have been the cost of retaining the
force in the country until they had consumed
them.</p>

<p>The British troops were all with this
column, but there were several native units
as well. One arrived at a post and found it
full of many good things that could not be
carried on. Restrained only by fear of filling
the troops to a tension beyond what the medical
officers thought desirable, one accosted commanding
officers, and asked with one's best
shop-walker's manner what they would like
to-day. A few hundredweight of jam and
pickles would be doled out for the asking, or,
in the case of native troops, similar quantities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of tea and ghi and goor. The coolis were
my best customers. The amount of tea and
goor they took away and consumed with
benefit to themselves was surprising. They
worked all the better for it and marched into
Gyantse carrying record loads.</p>

<p>The stores still left over at each place
were solemnly presented to the local peasants
who came up, and, regarding the affair as
a huge joke, went away laden with bundles
selected at random from, as it were, a huge
bran-pie. Rum was withheld from them,
but I should have liked to see the effect
of their consumption of some of the things
they got, as, for instance, of an unsuspecting
draught of neat lime-juice, or a mouthful of
chillies.</p>

<p>So on we marched over that stiff pass
into Pete-jong, along Lake Palti shining in
this clear-set wintry weather with its true
turquoise colours, past Nagartse and up
through the barren gorge that leads to the
summit of the Karo-L√†, down the Karo-L√†<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
regretfully, doubting whether we should
ever reach such heights again, into the
Ralung plain, and down the long glen to
Gyantse.</p>

<p>Our appearance in those days was not
spick and span. We were very much out
at elbows, the breeches of both soldiers and
followers were frequently patched with odd
bits of Tibetan woollen cloth, or even in
some cases with bits of the gunny of gunny
bags. I have known the red cloth of the
typical lama's robe adapted to these purposes.
With wear it turns into a cherry colour. My
own orderly, who was fitted out with a complete
pair of continuations of this cloth, looked
in the distance like a trooper of the 11th
Hussars (the overalls of that regiment being
famous for that colour).</p>

<p>More curious still were the additions to
the wardrobe in the shape of blankets and
sentries' cloaks, which we brought from
Lhassa, the woollen goods of that town
being warm and serviceable, but rather outlandish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
The sentries' cloaks were merely
oblong pieces of cloth with a hole in the
centre, through which the sentry put his
head, and of all sorts of colours&mdash;quite
enough in themselves to frighten the nocturnal
miscreant.</p>

<p>But most curious sight of all, if one could
have looked on from the outside, would have
been the collection of dogs which we brought
with us. The dog that Tommy had left at
home was of course the familiar type of
square-jowled sturdy monster, who, by a process
of natural selection and survival of the
fittest, has been evolved out of many types,
and now rules supreme in cantonment barracks.
His master at Lhassa had consoled
himself with another sort, and it was a
touching sight to see great bearded men
sometimes leading, but as often as not
carrying, on the march dainty little lap-dogs,
of kinds that resembled the Pomeranian, the
Skye terrier, or the King Charles' spaniel.
One or two Tibetan mastiffs&mdash;more like huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
Welsh collies than mastiffs&mdash;also accompanied
us.</p>

<p>At Gyantse we were halted for a few
days, upon one of which the G.O.C. held
his farewell parade, making us a sympathetic
speech which will be remembered by all of
us. Then we marched past. My lot was to
command a squad of veterans whose duties
for years had been confined to the supply of
the army. We got along somehow, more by
innate intelligence than knowledge of drill,
going through various giddy evolutions in no
particular formation and by the shortest cut,
and arriving at the saluting base aided only
by the bump of locality. There of course
we braced ourselves and marched past, and
turned our eyes sharply to the right as though
we had never left the barrack square.</p>

<p>From Gyantse onwards I was in the first
column, and thus missed certain hardships.
It was nice bracing weather. We had cool
fine days, at night twenty degrees of frost
and often biting cold winds that took the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
skin off the nose and chapped the lips and
the lobes of the ear, but were on the whole
salubrious. The same weather was with us
all the way, up through Kangma and the
Red Idol gorge to Kalatso, past Dochen and
into the Tuna plain, over the Tang-L√†, into
Phari and down through the Gautsa glens,
where the pine-forests smelt of Indian hill
stations, and into Chumbi. As we reached
Chumbi the clouds were gathering.</p>

<p>That night, with the outer fly of my tent
taken out of store and erected over me, I went
to bed secure in its extra protection, thinking
casually that it might perhaps rain in the
night. In the early morning I was woken
with a crash, and felt a great weight squeezing
my whole body, but leaving my head clear.
Striking a light I found the upright tent pole
near my feet broken in two. Looking through
a corner of the tent I saw the ground all covered
with snow, and realised that the weight on my
body was the snow that had accumulated on
the tent, broken the tent pole, and fallen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
upon me. It was six o'clock. My orderly
and syce came to my rescue. They lifted
the snow off me and took away my tent pole
to a carpenter to get it mended, while in
what space was still left within the tent I
found I could still breathe, and so slept
peacefully till in an hour my tent pole was
brought back mended and the tent reconstructed,
and I could get up in comfort.</p>

<p>I had had a very mild experience. Grief
of a worse kind had been widespread through
the night, many officers and men losing their
only shelter irretrievably at two or three in the
morning. The second column came in that
afternoon rather worn and battered, and the
third column&mdash;for from Gyantse we had become
three&mdash;was snowed up for two nights
at Phari after a terrible march over the Tang-L√†
from Tuna. Their eventual march into
Chumbi was also a severe ordeal. At
Chumbi it remained to await one's day of
release. The snow delayed the passage of
the troops hardly at all. Leaving Chumbi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
in small detachments and using both the
Jalap-L√† and Natu-L√† routes, they gradually
disappeared. At length my own turn came.
Leaving Chumbi one fine morning, and finding
myself again a passenger, I hastened by
double marches to India across the Natu-L√†
down to Gangtok, through Sikkim, and into
Siliguri. Strange it was to think, as, after
that last hot double march from Riang, one
sat under the punkah in Siliguri refreshment
room, drinking tumbler after tumbler of iced
ginger-beer, that three days before one had
pulled icicles from one's beard on the top of
the Natu-L√†.</p>

<p>Pleasant to get into the Darjiling mail
that night and speed to Calcutta; pleasant to
feel oneself wrapped in the civilisation of the
Indian metropolis; pleasanter still to take train
at Howrah, and be carried up country to the
crisp cool autumn of the Panjab and to one's
own fireside.</p>

<p>So the show was over&mdash;all over but for
its memories, which for my own part were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
mainly agreeable. As he lays those memories
aside, the selfish soldier's wish can
hardly be other than that on some convenient
date in spring time not too many years
distant, ere the person is too stout and the
legs too stiff to relish those high passes,
some truculent grand lama may necessitate
and a kind Government organise another
summer trip to Lhassa.</p>
